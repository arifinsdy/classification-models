donate how big tobacco helped create the junkman environment public relations science tobacco by sheldon rampton and john stauber in the biographical sketch that accompanies the fear profiteers see cover story of this issue steven milloy describes himself as the publisher of the junk science home page and an adjunct scholar at the cato institute milloy appears frequently on radio and television has testified on risk assessment and superfund before the us congress and has lectured before numerous organizations it adds noting that he has also written articles that have appeared in the new york post usa today washington times the chicago suntimes and the investors business daily these facts are all accurate as far they go but they say nothing about how milloy came to be a prominent debunker of junk science this omission is undoubtedly by design because it would certainly be embarrassing to admit that a selfproclaimed scientific reformer got his start as a behindthescenes lobbyist for the tobacco industry which has arguably done more to corrupt science than any other industry in history early in his career milloy worked for a company called multinational business services a washington lobby shop that philip morris described as its primary contact on the issue of secondhand cigarette smoke in the early s later he became executive director of the advancement of sound science coalition tassc an organization that was covertly created by philip morris for the express purpose of generating scientific controversy regarding the link between secondhand smoke and cancer the whitecoat project one of the forerunners of tassc at philip morris was a  proposal for the whitecoat project named after the white laboratory coats that scientists sometimes wear the project had four goals resist and roll back smoking restrictions restore smoker confidence reverse scientific and popular misconception that ets is harmful restore social acceptability of smoking to achieve these goals the plan was to first generate a body of scientific and technical knowledge through research undertaken by whitecoats contract laboratories and commercial organizations then disseminate and exploit such knowledge through specific communication programs covington  burling pms law firm would function as the executive arm of the whitecoat project acting as a legal buffer    the interface with the operating units whitecoats laboratories etc the effort to create a scientific defense for secondhand smoke was only one component in the tobacco industrys multimilliondollar pr campaign to defeat cigarette excise taxes a philip morris strategy document outlined plans for coop efforts with third party tax organizationslibertarian antitaxation think tanks such as americans for tax reform citizens for a sound economy citizens for tax justice and the tax foundation other third party allies included the national journalism center the heartland institute the claremont institute and national empowerment television a conservative tv network in one memo to philip morris ceo michael a miles vice president craig l fuller noted that he was working with many third party allies to develop position papers opeds and letters to the editor detailing how tobacco is already one of the most heavily regulated products in the marketplace and derailing arguments against proposed bans on tobacco advertising through the pr firm of bursonmarsteller philip morris also created the national smokers alliance a supposedly independent organization of individual smokers which claimed that bans on smoking in public places infringed on basic american freedoms the nsa was a grassroots version of the third party technique designed to create the impression of a citizen groundswell against smoking restrictions bursonmarsteller spent millions of dollars of tobacco industry money to get the nsa up and runningbuying fullpage newspaper ads hiring paid canvassers and telemarketers setting up a tollfree  number and publishing newsletters and other folksy grassroots materials to mobilize the puffing masses the nsas stated mission was to empower smokers to reclaim their rightsalthough behind closed doors industry executives fretted that they didnt want this rhetoric to go too far they were well aware of opinion polls showing that  percent of all adult smokers wish they could kick the habit the issue of empowerment of smokers was viewed as somewhat dangerous stated a tobacco strategy document we dont want to empower them to the point that theyll quit due to the publicity associated with bursonmarstellers role in setting up the nsa philip morris executives felt that it was best to select some other pr firm to handle the launch of tassc they settled on apco associates a subsidiary of the international advertising and pr firm of gcigrey associates which agreed to organize coalition efforts to provide information with respect to the ets issues to the media and to public officials in exchange for a monthly retainer of  plus expenses the purpose of tassc as described in a memo from apcos tom hockaday and neal cohen was to link the tobacco issue with other more politically correct productsin other words to make the case that efforts to regulate tobacco were based on the same junk science as efforts to regulate food additives automobile emissions and other industrial products that had not yet achieved tobaccos pariah status the credibility of epa is defeatable but not on the basis of ets alone stated a philip morris strategy document it must be part of a larger mosaic that concentrates all of the epas enemies against it at one time originally dubbed the restoring integrity to science coalition the advancement of sound science coalition was later renamed to resemble the venerable american association for the advancement of science after apcos planners realized that the resulting acronym was not terribly flatteringassc or worse the ass coalitionthey began putting a capitalized article the at the beginning of the name and tassc was born a national coalition intended to educate the media public officials and the public about the dangers of junk science  in september  apco president margery kraus sent a memo to philip morris communications director vic han we look forward to the successful launching of tassc this fall she stated we believe the groundwork we conduct to complete the launch will enable tassc to expand and assist philip morris in its efforts with issues in targeted states in  apcos work would focus on expanding tasscs membership finding outside money to help conceal the role of philip morris as its primary funder compiling a litany of additional examples of unsound science and coordinating and directing outreach to the scientific and academic communities apco would also direct and manage former new mexico governor garrey carruthers who had been hired as tasscs spokesman this includes developing and maintaining his schedule prioritizing his time and energies and briefing carruthers and other appropriate tassc representatives kraus wrote outlining a comprehensive media relations strategy designed to maximize the use of tassc and its members into philip morriss issues in targeted states    this includes using tassc as a tool in targeted legislative battles planned activities included publishing a monthly newsletter frequent news releases drafting boilerplate speeches and oped pieces to be used by tassc representatives and placing articles in various trade publications to help recruit members from the agriculture chemical biotechnology and food additive industries in addition to apcos monthly fee  per month was budgeted to compensate garrey carruthers considerable effort was expended to conceal the fact that tassc was created and funded by philip morris apco recommended that tassc first be introduced to the public through a decentralized launch outside the large markets of washington dc and new york in order to avoid cynical reporters from major media increasingly today one can find examples of junk science that compromise the integrity of the field of science and at the same time create a scare environment where unnecessary regulations on industry in general and on the consumer products industry in particular are rammed through without respect to rhyme reason effect or cause michael a miles former ceo of the philip morris tobacco company in smaller markets apco reasoned there would be less reviewingchallenging of tassc messages also a decentralized launch would limit potential for counterattack the opponents of tassc tend to concentrate their efforts in top markets while skipping the secondary markets this approach sends tasscs message initially into these more receptive marketsand enables us to build upon early successes the plan included a barnstorming media tour by garrey carruthers of these secondary markets apco will arrange ontheground visits with three to four reporters in each city these interviews using tasscs trained spokespeople thirdparty allies eg authors of books on unsound science members of the tassc science board andor governor carruthers will be scheduled for a one to two day media tour in each city to set up the interviews apco used a list of sympathetic reporters provided by john boltz a manager of media affairs at philip morris we thought it best to remove any possible link to pm thus boltz is not making the calls noted philip morris public affairs director jack lenzi with regard to media inquiries to pm about tassc i am putting together some q and a we will not deny being a corporate membersponsor will not specify dollars and will refer them to the tassc  number being manned by david sheon apco other plans developed later included creation of a tassc internet page that could be used to broadly distribute published studiespapers favorable to smokingets debate and release pm authored papers    on ets science and bad sciencebad public policy carruthers began his media tour in december with stopovers in cities including san diego dallas and denver news releases sent out in advance of each stop described tassc as a grassrootsbased notforprofit watchdog group of scientists and representatives from universities independent organizations and industry that advocates the use of sound science in the public policy arena as examples of unsound science it pointed to the asbestos abatement guidelines the dioxin scare in times beach missouri and unprecedented regulations to limit radon levels in drinking water in texas local tassc recruits involved in the launch included dr margaret maxey and floy lilley both of the university of texas the clean air act is a perfect example of laboratory science being superficially applied to reality lilley said carruthers took the opportunity to inveigh against politicized uses of science by the environmental protection agency to make science fit with the political leanings of special interests epas studies he complained are frequently carried out without the benefit of peer review or quality assurance in denver carruthers told a local radio station that the public has been shafted by shoddy science and it has cost consumers and government a good deal of money when asked who was financing tassc carruthers sidestepped the question we dont want to be caught being a crusader for a single industry he said were not out here defending the chemical industry were not out here defending the automobile industry or the petroleum industry or the tobacco industry were here just to ensure that sound science is used virtually every news release made some reference to the socalled alar scare in which consumers mobilized to stop apple growers from using the pesticide alar the us epa has classified alar as a probable carcinogen and subsequent reports from the world health organization and the us public health service had concurred with that judgment proindustry groups continue to defend the chemical however as does former us surgeon general c everett koop in its news releases tassc made a point of invoking koops name whenever possible in an advertorial titled science a tool not a weapon tassc noted that respected experts including thensurgeon general c everett koop said the scientific evidence showed no likelihood of harm from alar    this is not an isolated case of bad science being used by policymakers it added its happened regarding asbestos dioxin and toxic waste    its happening in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke or secondhand smoke the studies done so far on the topic do not demonstrate evidence that secondhand smoke causes cancer even though that is the popular wisdom to the casual reader it would almost appear as if dr koop were a defender of environmental tobacco smoke rather than one of its most prominent public critics eurotassc in  philip morris budgeted  in funding for tassc in consultation with apco and bursonmarsteller the company began planning to set up a second european organization tentatively named scientists for sound public policy later renamed the european science and environment forum like tassc the european organization would attempt to smuggle tobacco advocacy into a larger bundle of sound science issues including the ban on growth hormone for livestock ban on geneticallyengineered bovine growth hormone to improve milk production pesticide restrictions ban on indoor smoking restrictions on use of chlorine ban on certain pharmaceutical products restrictions on the use of biotechnology the public and policymakers needed to be educated bursonmarsteller explained because political decisionmakers are vulnerable to activists emotional appeals and press campaigns    the precautionary principle is now the accepted guideline even if a hypothesis is not  percent scientifically proven action should be taken eg global warming companies that bm thought could be recruited to support the european endeavor would include makers of consumer products food beverages tobacco packaging industry agrichemical industry chemical industry pharmaceutical industry biotech industry electric power industry telecommunications a turf war broke out between bursonmarsteller and apco over the question of which pr firm should handle the european campaign jim lindheim of bursonmarsteller laid claim to the account by stressing his firms alreadyproven expertise at defending tobacco science in europe we have the network much of which is already sensitized to pms special needs he stated we have a lot of experience in every country working with scientists    weve got a large client base with scientific problems whom we can tap for sponsorship apcos margery kraus responded by reminding philip morris regulatory affairs director matthew winokur that bursonmarstellers long history of tobacco industry work was public knowledge and therefore might taint the endeavor given the sensitivities of other tassc activities and a previous decision not to have tassc work directly with burson due to these sensitivities in other tassc work i did not feel comfortable having steig or anyone else from burson assume primary responsibility for working with tassc scientists kraus stated as for experience handling scientific problems she pointed to her parent companys work for the following industries impacted by science and environmental policy decisions chemical pharmaceutical nuclear waste management and motor industries power generation biotech products packaging and detergents and paint they have advised clients on a number of issues including agricultural manufacturing animal testing chlorine dioxins toxic waste ozonecfcs power generation coastal pollution lead in gasoline polyurethanes lubricants tassc was designed to appear outwardly like a broad coalition of scientists from multiple disciplines the other industries and interestsbiotech chemical toxic waste coastal pollution lubricantsserved as protective camouflage concealing the tobacco money that was at the heart of the endeavor tassc signed up support from corporate executives at santa fe pacific gold corporation procter  gamble the louisiana chemical association the national pest control association general motors lawrence livermore national laboratory exxon wr grace  co amoco occidental petroleum m chevron and dow chemical many of its numerous news releases attacking junk science made no mention of tobacco whatsoever it objected to government guidelines for asbestos abatement said the dioxin scare in times beach missouri was a tempest in a teapot scoffed at the need for an epa superfund cleanup in aspen colorado dismissed reports of health effects related to use of the norplant contraceptive denounced the clean water act and orchestrated a letterwriting campaign to oppose any government action aimed at limiting industrial activities linked to global warming trash talk with the junkman in february  apco vice president neal cohen made the mistake of boasting candidly about some of the sneaky tactics his company uses to set up front groups his remarks were made at a conference of the public affairs council pac an exclusive association of topranking lobbyists and pr people new york times political reporter jane fritsch later used his remarks as the basis for a march  article titled sometimes lobbyists strive to keep public in the dark shortly after apco suffered this embarrassment the responsibility for managing tassc was quietly transferred to the eop group a wellconnected washingtonbased lobby firm whose clients have included the american crop protection association the chief trade association of the pesticide industry the american petroleum institute att the business roundtable the chlorine chemistry council dow chemical company edison electric institute nuclear power fort howard corp a paper manufacturer international food additives council monsanto co national mining association and the nuclear energy institute in march  eop lobbyist steven milloy described in a tassc news release as a nationally known expert and author on environmental risk and regulatory policy issues became tasscs executive director steven brings not only a deep and strong academic and professional background to tassc but he brings an equally deep strong and passionate commitment to the principle of using sound science in making public policy decisions said garrey carruthers the issue of junk science has become the topic of network news specials major articles in newspapers and a key topic in congress and legislatures around the country i look forward to working with steven to continue to drive home the need for sound science in public policy making although the news release referred to milloys work over the last six years on environmental and regulatory policy issues it did not mention that he had worked specifically for the tobacco industry during  milloy worked for james tozzi at multinational business services tozzi a former career bureaucrat at the us office of management and budget who had spearheaded the reaganera omb campaign to gut environmental regulations is described in internal philip morris documents as the companys primary contact on the epaets risk assessment during the second half of  during that period it noted tozzi has been invaluable in executing our washington efforts including generating technical briefing papers numerous letters to agencies and media interviews a service for which philip morris paid an estimated  in consulting fees philip morris also paid tozzis company another  to establish a nonprofit thinktank called the institute for regulatory policy irp on behalf of philip morris the irp put together three different coalitions which support sound sciencecoalition for executive order coalition for moratorium on risk assessments and coalition of cities and states on environmental mandates    irp could work with us as well as apco in a coordinated manner pms boland and borelli had noted in february  after leaving tozzis service milloy became president of his own organization called the regulatory impact analysis project inc where he wrote a couple of reports arguing that most environmental risks are so small or indistinguishable that their existence cannot be proven shortly thereafter he launched the junk science home page calling himself the junkman he offered daily attacks on environmentalists public health and food safety regulators antinuclear and animal rights activists and a wide range of other targets that he accused of using unsound science to advance various political agendas milloy was also active in defense of the tobacco industry particularly in regard to the issue of environmental tobacco smoke he dismissed the epas  report linking secondhand smoke to cancer as a joke and when the british medical journal published its own study with similar results in  he scoffed that it remains a joke today after one researcher published a study linking secondhand smoke to cancer milloy wrote that she must have pictures of journal editors in compromising positions with farm animals how else can you explain her studies seeing the light of day in august  the new york times reported that milloy was one of the paid speakers at a miami briefing for foreign reporters sponsored by the britishamerican tobacco company whose brown  williamson unit makes popular cigarettes like kool carlton and lucky strike at the briefing which was offlimits to us journalists the company flew in dozens of reporters from countries including brazil argentina chile and peru and paid for their hotel rooms and expensive meals while the reporters sat through presentations that ridiculed lawsuitdriven societies like the united states for using unsound science to raise questions about infinitesimal if not hypothetical risks related to inhaling a whiff of tobacco smoke the legacy in  university of pennsylvania professor edward s herman surveyed  articles in mainstream newspapers that used the term junk science during the years  through  only  percent of the articles used the term in reference to corporatemanipulated science by contrast  percent used the term junk science in reference to scientific arguments used by environmentalists other corporate critics or personalinjury lawyers engaged in suing corporations whats starting to happen is that this term junk science is being thrown around all the time says lucinda finley a law professor from the state university of new york at buffalo who specializes in product liability and womens health people are calling scientists who disagree with them purveyors of junk but what were really talking about is a very normal process of scientific disagreement and giveandtake calling someone a junk scientist is just a way of shutting them up like other corporatefunded front groups the organizations that flack for sound science are sometimes flybynight organizations called into existence for a particular cause or legislative lobby campaign they often dry up and blow away once the campaign is over the tendency of groups to appear and disappear creates another form of camouflage making it difficult for journalists and everyday citizens to sort out the bewildering proliferation of names and acronyms this was indeed what happened with the advancement of sound science coalition which was quietly retired in late  its legacy however continues dozens if not hundreds of industryfunded organizations and conservative think tanks continue to wave the sound science banner milloys junk science home page remains active claiming sponsorship from citizens for the integrity of science about which no further information is publicly available the tone of the junk science home page appears calculated to lower rather than elevate scientific discourse that tone is particularly notable in its extended attack on our stolen future the book about endocrinedisrupting chemicals by theo colborn dianne dumanoski and peter myers milloys online parody titled our swollen future includes a cartoon depiction of colborn hauling a wheelbarrow of money to the bank her implied motive for writing the book and refers to dianne dumanoski as dianne dumbasanoxski casual visitors to milloys junk science home page might be tempted to dismiss him as merely an obnoxious adolescent with a website they would be surprised to discover that he is a wellconnected fixture in conservative washington policy circles he currently holds the title of adjunct scholar at the libertarian cato institute which was rated the fourth most influential think tank in washington dc in a  survey of congressional staffers and journalists milloy is also highly visible on the internet in addition to publishing the junk science home page and a website for the no more scares campaign milloy also operates a consumer distorts website devoted to attacking consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine which milloy accuses of socialism sensationalism and scaring consumers away
