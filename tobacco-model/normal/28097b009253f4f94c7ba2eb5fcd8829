Monday, April 16, 2012 gDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets), such as weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays, or music player controls, onto your desktop, where they are sitting there in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. The possibilities are really endless and they are always there to serve you whenever you need them, just one key-press away. The system is not restricted to one desktop environment, but currently works on most of the modern Unix desktops (including GNOME, KDE, Xfce). gDesklets is a GNOME program which provides the architecture for small applets (desktop widgets) to be placed on top of the user's desktop. It is comparable to other desktop widget programs. The applets placed on the desktop are meant to be quick ways for the user to retrieve information and not get in the way of normal activity. The small programs that are run inside gDesklets are called desklets and are small Python applets loaded into the gDesklets daemon. There are many gDesklets available from the gDesklets home page. Some of them include:     Clocks     Calendars     Docking     Weather     RSS feed aggregators     Controls for other applications (such as XMMS and Pidgin)     Animated toolbars     Desktop notes     System monitors To install gDesklets, go to System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager: After Synaptic has started, you can either browse all packages to find the gDesklets package, or you use the Search function: After you've found the gDesklets package, click on it and select Mark for Installation: The package gdesklets-data will be marked for installation as a dependency of the gdesklets package (gdesklets-data contains lots of pre-configured desktop widgets): Click on Apply to start the installation: Click on Apply again: The two packages are downloaded and installed: After the installation you can close the Synaptic Package Manager: Now that gDesklets is installed, go to Applications > Accessories and click on gDesklets to start it: If you start it for the first time, a message will pop up. Click on Close to make it go away: Now browse the categories in the gDesklets window. You will find lots of widgets that you can install. I want to install the SideCandy CPU monitor, so I double-click it: The SideCandy CPU widget will appear on the desktop, and you can move it to your desired location on the desktop with the mouse. Click with the mouse to lock it to your desired location: We've just installed our first desktop widget. Of course, we can use more than one at the same time. For example, I also want to know the state of my RAM and SWAP, so I double-click the SideCandy RAM/SWAP desklet in the gDesklets window and place it below my CPU monitor: To configure/move/remove a desklet, just right-click on it and select from the menu: The SideCandy CPU widget will appear on the desktop, and you can move it to your desired location on the desktop with the mouse. Click with the mouse to lock it to your desired location: We've just installed our first desktop widget. Of course, we can use more than one at the same time. For example, I also want to know the state of my RAM and SWAP, so I double-click the SideCandy RAM/SWAP desklet in the gDesklets window and place it below my CPU monitor: To configure/move/remove a desklet, just right-click on it and select from the menu: The GoodWeather configuration window pops up. In the Location Code field, paste the location code (e.g. GMXX0078 for Lüneburg): Further down in the same window, you can specify what details (beside the temperature) the desklet should display (e.g. humidity, location (so that we know it displays the details for our area), update time, etc.): After you've closed the configuration window, the GoodWeather desklet should display the correct details for your area: 5 Making Desklets Start Automatically After Reboots Now there's a little problem: whenever we reboot our system or log out of the current session, our desklets are gone. Of course, we don't want to configure them again from the beginning each time we log in to our desktop. To make our desklets start automatically after reboots, we go to System > Preferences > Sessions: In the Sessions window that opens go to the Startup Programs tab and click on Add: The Add Startup Program window opens. Type in gdesklets (all lowercase!) as Startup Command and click on OK: That's it. Now whenever you log in to your desktop again, your desklets will start automatically.   source: HowtoForge   If you liked this article, subscribe to the feed by clicking the image below to keep informed about new contents of the blog: Published by: Ubuntuland a 2:10 AM 0 comments Email This BlogThis!

Tuesday, April 10, 2012 The GUVCViewer provides "a simple GTK interface for capturing and viewing video from devices supported by the linux UVC driver". Introduction.   This project aims at providing a simple GTK interface for capturing and viewing video from devices supported by the linux UVC driver, although it should also work with any v4l2 compatible device. The project is based on luvcview for video rendering, but all controls are build using a GTK2 interface. You can also use guvcview (since version 0.9.9) has a control window only, (from console: guvcview --control_only), this allows image control on other apps, like ekiga, cheese, mplayer, skype,ecc. Audio. Guvcview audio support is based on the portaudio library, up until version 0.9.3 the blocking API was used for audio capture, since version 0.9.4 the callback method is used instead, this provides better performance, it is also the preferred method for the portaudio API.  All interfaces (ALSA, OSD, JACK, ...) supported by portaudio should be available in guvcview. Just make sure portaudio was compiled with the desired interfaces enabled. UVC Dynamic controls. The linux UVC driver has an implementation for extension controls (these are vendor specific controls and are supported in the UVC spec.), they are called dynamic controls since they must be dynamically loaded into the driver. Until today only logitech has supplied specs for their UVC webcam extension controls, these are supported by guvcview. In new driver revisions admin rights are needed in order to add these controls to the driver, so there are basically two solutions: 1- start guvcview has root (sudo for debian/ubuntu) at least once per session, since version 1.2.0 you can do this with the option --add_ctrls avoiding the need to fully launch guvcview 2- install libwebcam this software has a udev script that should add the necessary controls to your logitech camera. Download: [guvcview_1.4.5-1ubuntu1.dsc] [guvcview_1.4.5.orig.tar.gz] [guvcview_1.4.5-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.gz] Guvcview can be downloaded from the project page at sourceforge in two forms: A source code tarball (tar.gz) or debian package (.deb) Ubuntu users can use my repository at launchpad, just add it to your system software sources: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pj-assis/ppa now just update it: sudo apt-get update You should now be able to install guvcview with sudo apt-get install guvcview. The latest development revision is also available through svn. It enables access to far more camera parameters than v4l2ucp, especially image resolution Here is how I use the panels, to capture still images:     Since I am not going to make a video with an audio track, I do not use the audio panel at all. And I do not actually use the video panel when capturing still images, but it is appropriate to note that some of the controls for capturing still images are on the video panel. For example: the image resolution control and the specification for a base name (and directory) for the image file(s).     [NOTE to maintainers of the 'guvcview' program (Nobuhiro Iwamatsu - iwamatsu at debian dot org, in 2010 ---- or to documenter Paulo Assis - pj.assis at gmail dot com): The organization of those options should be changed. Either move them to the Image Control panel --- or move the resolution control to a new panel that provides controls that are applicable to both still image capture and video image capture.]     Once I get the image lined up - with magnification, focus, and brightness set - I simply click on the 'Cap. Image' button at the bottom of the 'GUVCViewer Controls' window.     I have it set so the image goes into a subdirectory of my home directory called 'MICROSCOPE' --- usually with a filename like 'Image-3.jpg'. I navigate to that directory (using the Nautilus file manager, available in Ubuntu Linux) and right-click on the filename to select an application to edit the image file.     I like to use an image processing program called 'mtpaint' to crop the file --- and, if necessary, adjust the brightness of the image using the 'Gamma correction' option of the 'Transform colors' option in 'mtpaint'. You can also do things like 'invert' the image to change a dark-on-light image to a light-on-dark image. I have started a web page with helpful hints on how to use 'mtpaint'.     You will typically also rename the file and move it to an appropriate directory.   Launching 'guvcview' : To startup 'guvcview' so that it recognizes the USB microscope (instead of a web cam or other video device) --- and so that it is ready to take still images rather than video, I made a startup script called 'guvc.sh'. I will describe the script contents in another section below. You can simply highlight and paste that code into your own script file on your own Linux computer. When one has the script file ready, it is easy to make an icon on your desktop to launch the script --- which immediately brings up the 'guvcview' control panel window and the viewport window. The viewport window immediately shows the image that the microscope is capturing. (The following images, that show how to make the desktop icon, were captured on an Ubuntu 9.10 PC, using the Gnome desktop environment.) You simply right-click on the (Gnome) desktop and choose the 'Create Launcher ...' option from the popup menu. Here is an image of that popup menu. When you choose 'Create Launcher...', you are presented with this Create Launcher panel, in which you enter a name for your icon and the fully-qualified name of the script file that you want to launch by double-clicking on the desktop icon. Here is the help that you get for 'guvcview' by entering the command 'guvcview -h' at a command prompt in a terminal window on Linux:  $ guvcview -h

 As a further note on the run-parameters of 'guvcview':  I found that the 'guvcview' program saves its default run parameters (and changes that you make to them when you use the program) in 'rc' (run control) hidden files in your home directory. In fact, for a video device assigned to /dev/video0, 'guvcview' creates a '.guvcviewrc' file. And if there is a second video device assigned to /dev/video1, 'guvcview' creates a '.guvcviewrc-video1' file.  In my case, the /dev/video0 device corresponded to a USB webcam -- a Logitech C500. And the /dev/video1 device corresponded to the Veho USB microscope.  For easy reference, here is a sample image of a '.guvcviewrc-video1' file which corresponded to the Veho VMS-001 USB microscope. For completeness, here is a sample image of a '.guvcviewrc' file which corresponded to the Logitech C500 webcam. I see that, in the '.guvcviewrc-video1' file, there is a 'sound=' parameter that can be set to 0 or 1. There does not seem to be such a parameter option via the guvcview command line options. It would be handy to specify something like '-a 0' to indicate that no sound recording is wanted. The initialization messages coming from 'guvcview' indicate that it spends a little processing time, during startup, trying to determine if sound recording should be done. Here is a sample of 'guvcview' messages from when the program starts up. Note that there are four 'bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)'
messages at the beginning, indicating that the progam is trying to setup sound recording.

You can use it to save tracks from an Audio CD as any of WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, WavPack, Musepack, AAC, and Monkey's Audio files. I don't think there is a default "ripper" program in Ubuntu linux. A brief search in the Applications ... Ubuntu Software Center for "rip" gives you choices of RipperX, RipOff, and Asunder. RipOff is easy to use but didn't offer me enough control. I liked the features of RipperX, but I had it crash trying to "make MP3s from existing WAV files".  I was very pleased with what I can do with Asunder in terms of ripping multiple formats of music from a single loading of my CD. A basic tutorial follows. Installing the Asunder Software: If you are comfortable with the terminal: me@myhost$ sudo apt-get install asunderTo install the asunder graphically, go to "Applications... Ubuntu Software Center" and type "asunder" in the search box and click the "Install" button. Alternatively, the program is located in the "Sound & Video" section. You will be prompted for the Administrator password. If you are the only user, then you qualify. Remarks: I would hope that the dependencies needed for MP3 ripping are included in the install. If you happen to have any problem with ripping a certain format of music file, consult the Ubuntu Restricted Formats Wiki page. Getting Started: You can't do much without something to rip, so put an audio CD in your drive. If you get a message to open a program other than asunder, then Cancel it out. Start Asunder from "Applications... Sound & Video... Asunder CD Ripper". There will be a brief delay and you may see the message "Getting disc info from the Internet" at the bottom of the window. Then interface will look something like this: Changes to Disc Information: This is an optional step. Most of the time the information from the CDDB lookup is acceptable "as is". I have found two cases where I wanted to change the information, though, and here is what you do. Remove Special Characters: Computers can be fussy. If you want to get rid of some special characters, like periods or slashes, then click on the name of the track you want to edit and it will become highlighted and "editable". When done, click somewhere else or press Enter to save the change. Adding Multiple Artists: Sometimes when a CD consists of multiple artists, you will find that the person who submitted the CDDB data repeated the term "Various" for the artist for each track. If you'd like more detail in your files, you can do this by unchecking the box next to "Single artist". You will then be given a new column called "Artist" in between the "Track" and "Title" columns that you can fill in for each track. Adding Genre: I did not find a way to customize the genre "on the fly" while ripping using Asunder. My advice is to sort your ripped files into directories (folders) according to genre. When you are done, it will then be a simple matter to bulk-update the genre for all the files in a folder using easytag, or some other MP3 tag editor. [Briefly, in easytag: Undo the preference about opening subfolders when browsing. Go to a folder and click the "select all" button. Type the genre you want in the genre field. Right-click and select the phrase like "apply to all items". Save all. Ripping Multiple Formats At Once This really doesn't take that long to do. I am including all the possible changes you might want to make. So far, we have only inserted a disc and started Asunder. I am describing a method to rip a CD at 2 different MP3 fixed bitrates with a minimal amount of effort and time. For example, to make a 256kbps and 96kbps files of the same tracks. The 256kbps files give you good sound quality with most average audio equipment. I need to use 96kbps files for an 8GB MP3 player for when I'm working, in order to get the musical variety I need. To get started, click on the "Preferences" button. In the "Genral" tab, make sure the option "Eject disc when finished" is UNCHECKED. Then click on the "Encode" tab. In my example, you would check the box next to the "WAV" file format in order to speed up the step that follows this one. Make sure the "Variable bit rate" box is unchecked and set the slider to 256kbps. [If you are a real audiofile, and need an LOSSLESS copy of your music for your computer, then go ahead and great a FLAC file as well. Keep in mind the files will be huge. Click the "Okay" button to return to the main window and click the "Rip" button to start the ripping process. This could take several minutes for an entire album, so have some news headlines to read or something... Ripping MP3 from existing WAV file: When the higher bitrate samples are completed, put them in separate folders (e.g., 256-rock, 256-jazz, etc.) because the next files created will have the same name and extension and you won't be able to "see" the bitrate. You probably don't need to keep a copy of the WAV files, so now UNCHECK the WAV box we checked earlier. Move the MP3 slider to the lower bitrate (128kbps, 96kbps, or even 64kbps if you are totally cramped for space). Click "Okay" and "Rip" again. You will see this prompt: Click in the "Remember" checkbox so you won't be bothered and say "NO" to overwriting the files, so that you will not create duplicates of the same file. This time the files will be created much faster. The progress bar will start at 50% because the existing WAV files are being reused to encode the new files. When done, put them into analagous folders (096-rock, 096-jazz, etc.) for later processing of the genre tags. This could be repeated for more bitrates, but you would NOT uncheck the WAV file creation until processing the last bitrate batch. Any changes you made to the Artist or Track names will be retained as long as you don't eject the CD.  Dependencies.
