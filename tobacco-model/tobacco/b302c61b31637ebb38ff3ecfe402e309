important hookah smoking skill to understand how to get the most smoke lets examine each factor that plays a role in the amount of hookah smoke and analyze them contents  the hookah tobacco brand  the hookah itself  packing the tobacco right  aluminum foil and holes the hookah tobacco brand the hookah tobacco is the most important factor in determining the amount of smoke modern styles of hookah tobacco that utilize glycerin in their blends produce large amounts of smoke more easily that classic styles of tobacco this is not to mistake that the tobacco alone can produce great smoke the hookah still needs to be prepared correctly the hookah itself the way the hookah itself is shaped and made can play a key role in the amount of smoke vase a large hookah vase allows more room between the hose port and the water which prevents the water from getting sucked up into the hose the shape of the vase doesnt really change the smoke at all stem a wider inner diameter stem allows for an easier draw a taller hookah makes for a harder draw finding a balance between the two is essential for a good session some people like a tighter draw and some like to feel no resistance its a matter of preference the only real concern is if a hookah is too short the smoke wont have time to cool completely and you may get a warmer smoke hose a long hose has the same effect as a long stem as it would require more energy to get the same amount of smoke a wider inner diameter makes the draw easier much like the stem as well again its a matter of preference also make sure there is not too much water in the base the air space left in the base the space not filled with water is the space that allows the cool smoke to store which is what you smoke at every puff so filling the base with too much water can result in water getting caught in the hose and if your hose is not washable then it can be ruined bowl different bowls have different properties as well some are made from different materials that have varying heat retaining and distribution properties that will change how you have to pack your bowl and manage your charcoal there are different style of bowls as well including classic egyptian bowls and funnels each bowl requires a different packing technique and some are better for different kinds of tobacco than others funnel style bowls are known for having an easier draw and being better for wetter tobaccos packing the tobacco right it is essential to pack the tobacco correctly in the bowl and it varies from bowl to bowl and between kinds of tobacco most tobacco should not be packed hard in other words dont push the tobacco or over pack it when preparing the bowl in an egyptian style bowl dense packing will not allow good air flow into the tobacco and therefore it will not allow all the tobacco cook evenly or completely in general its a good rule of thumb to sprinkle the tobacco in the bowl to leave enough room for good air flow aluminum foil and holes type of foil heavy duty foil is better than regular foil because it helps regulate the heat and avoid burning the tobacco some people use regular foil and use two layers two layers of hd foil is rarely needed and will restrict the heat too much to let the tobacco heat up properly both the number of holes and size of them can affect the amount of smoke coming out of a hookah number of holes too few holes dont allow enough air to pass through the foil and will make the hookah too hard to pull from also too many holes will let too much oxygen to pass through the foil and will result in fast burning and waste of your tobacco how many holes is the right number that depends a lot on the size of bowl that you are using smaller bowls would need fewer holes but as a rule of thumb one hold in the center and  or  concentric circles of close together hole is good size of holes many people like holes the size of a toothpick or a thumb tack assuming you are putting the holes on the aluminum foil after putting it on the bowl as supposed to using premade hookah foil with holes already in them when poking the holes push your toothpick or whatever you are using all the way so that it creates
