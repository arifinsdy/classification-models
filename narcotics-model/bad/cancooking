Cannabis Fantasy Cool Coloring Book
Posted on February 27, 2012 by The Oracle Comment
Like most medical marijuana users, I like to really indulge in my creative side when I medicate. Which is why I am so excited about today’s find! Cannabis Fantasy Cool Coloring book is no color book for kids! The author put together 20 pages of amazingly detailed pictures that are also somehow influenced by marijuana. These aren’t easy colorings, so even though there are only 20 pictures… I would imagine it would take you a while to finish. I was able to find a few examples of what’s in the book. I may even print these out for my next medicating session! :)
