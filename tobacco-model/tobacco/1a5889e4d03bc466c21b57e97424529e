march   happy new year from all here at ryo magazine and remember with at least  million voters in the us who enjoy tobacco products it would seem logical that their interest should be observed since government politicians at all levels seems to be incapable of achieving anything that vaguely resembles the will of the people or greater good for the nation is it not time to consider a single issue vote  million people can certainly turn the tide of any election and despite your other concerns which should be more important the current political system and its power elite are not likely to solve any problems so why not a single issue  the following quote purported from warren buffett says what weve been saying for years and it has been at the top of this publication for years read buffets comments then read below a whole lot of people are on the same page and perhaps a double issue vote is more appropriate both sane regulations and taxation of tobacco products and the dismissal by vote of all incumbent politicians weve been saying it for years now the first part is part of a direct quote as stated the second was part of a chain letter email that is circling the internet which claims buffett said the whole thing while we cannot confirm this the ideas are so close to what weve been saying for years that we felt it wise to provide  after all when does a good idea need a source our government is sure not up front on sources of information they use to rule by the way until weve added a bit more info in the magazine get the book throw them all out by peter schweizer details of congressional corruption are incredible whether its nancy pelosi or republican analogsthats why weve said for so long that no incumbents should get anywhere near public office ever again enjoy reading the details you will never get from political speak or from tv or radio news can be found if you are willing to read reading long and hard is your only source of information that is usually not bought and paid for by big corporations and by big government and when it is it is far easier to smell for the crap it is get schweizers book you will be shocked and it is  vetted as to its accuracy now for warren b warren buffett in a recent interview with cnbc offers one of the best quotes about the debt ceiling i could end the deficit in  minutes he told cnbc you just pass a law that says that anytime there is a deficit of more than  of gdp all sitting members of congress are ineligible for reelectionthe th amendment granting the right to vote for  yearolds took only  months   days to be ratified why simple the people demanded it that was in   before computers email cell phones etcof the  amendments to the constitution seven  took one  year or less to become the law of the land  all because of public pressure here is what he proposes  with a few comments by the editor  pass it on congressional reform act of   no tenure  no pension a congressmanwoman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay no benefit when theyre out of office  congress past present  future participates in social security all funds in the congressional retirement fund move to the social security system immediately all future funds flow into the social security system and congress participates with the american people it may not be used for any other purpose  congress may purchase their own retirement plan just as all americans may do change may to must or do without as do many of us  congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise congressional pay will rise by the lower of cpi consumer price index or  both too generous  congress loses their current health care system and participates in the same health care system as the american people which means they buy a policy if they can afford it  congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the american people surprisingly in many instances this is not currently the law  all contracts with past and present congressmenwomen are void effective  the american people did not make this contract with congressmenwomen congress made all these contracts for themselves serving in congress is an honor not a career the founding fathers envisioned citizen legislators so ours should serve their terms then go home and back to work this is how you fix congress editors note  no current politician is going to vote for this which is why it remains essential that no incumbents who are up for election remain in office after november  and one term representatives term limits including potus become a reality again below weve been saying this for many years it is the only solution and it requires enormous public pressure keep reading  the ed  as a preamble to the now ready massive update with lots of new products and videos as well as current information on the state of   well just about everything let me start  with the following much will be coming by the hour read the latest weekly update click on the link at lower left and then    consider the following     you can write all the letters you want you can claim foul all you want and you can whine about governmental takeover and intrusions into all things you hold dear again all you want but the true and sole remaining peaceful power that the american people have is their individual vote never again vote for any incumbent and from the pool of possible candidates who qualify ienot being a professional politician is an absolute first qualification along with displaying common sense those who display logic if you will and a dedication to seek and embrace good ideas on their merit alone and not just those ideas which are most likely to be funded by heavily lobbying special interests select those who will commit to one term limits we need one term presidents one term reps and one term senators we should never again tolerate politician as a job description or a profession its the only way this egregious trend of a more intrusive government at all levels will be reversed and it is the only way to get the large special interest groups out of the process our reps and senators at both the state and federal level should be banned from meeting with any group representing specific business ideologies or unions the only lobbying group that should be classified as having access are groups formed by private citizens that the rep or senator represent so along with the professional politician we need an abrupt end to the professional lobbyist they are practically one and the same only with laws passed by this new kind of representative will these institutional parasites be banned forever from the halls and back rooms of our governments true citizen groups are the only entities that should have access to lawmakers be sure to read once again  our position on tobacco following the update info section below  take the time to find qualified candidates in your local state and federal elections who will make such commitments letter writing to current politicians is no longer an effective strategy alone in reality it never has been you have to get involved directly with the candidate selection process you will not be alone this is the reality of the future a reality that also needs significant change in those who provide news to the people whether network or cable print or radio we are being under served by those we have to listen to most they are every bit as contaminated with dollars as the politicians and lobbyists we reject the only agenda that should be relevant is the absence of government unless it is requested and always be careful for any help for which you may ask there is always a price mass media journalism needs an unprecedented purging there is no right or left only greed and its damn time people realized the information they are being fed by such media has an all too obvious agenda which mostly results in fat wallets for the feeders of such blatant foggy soup they almost always have books to sell and will say practically anything to sell them boy this is going to be fun a full years worth and much more of research went into the upcoming issue and we think you will be amazed at what is now the new reality  by section the new update will include  tobacco this section will be the most controversial and is the one we absolutely wanted to wait to update until we had one more chance at the  tobaccoplusexpo in las vegas in early march  to finally and visually first hand verify what the various manufacturers are doing and what they intend to do if a couple of pending legislations pass the legislations at the federal level include the pact act which will effect online sales of tobacco products except perhaps cigars  more on that in a moment this industry manufacturers and special interest groups like the convenience store lobby all support pact they say that the internet sources of tobacco cut into the convenience store profits however what they dont talk about publicly is that the vast majority of convenience stores are attached to gas stations and the oil lobby is the real power behind these lesser lobbying groups ask yourself how many really great products would you buy at a convenience store i cant think of one they exist or should for those who need last minute or after hours goods to get one by until normal businesses open buying tobacco from these establishments is no more logical than trying to buy a good guitar or a good set of tools from them tobacco is a serious purchase and the customer is best served by people who specialize in it many online sellers of tobacco have a whole lot more knowledge of tobacco than you will find at any convenience store or unfortunately even more than many so called tobacco outlets that mostly sell cigarettes availability of products through the internet is a driving factor for brick and mortar stores to carry a wider range of products with no competition from the net states would have unlimited power to even further raise taxes and local retailers could very likely decide to carry a much more narrow selection of products as their customers would have no alternative choice much more on this in the editorial section when i return  the second piece of legislation to be kind is known as the tobacco tax parity act which involves the controversy created by a number of ryo tobacco manufacturers switching to pipe tobacco blends exclusively obviously the excise tax on pipe tobacco is th of that on rolling tobacco so though we encouraged certain manufacturers not to go down this path it was their choice congress now constantly harassed by their respective state governments want to equalize the tax on both products by raising the tax on pipe tobacco to the same level as rolling tobacco about  per pound most of you are already aware that rolling tobacco was raised by the latest schip from  per pound to this ridiculous  level you cant blame the ryo manufacturers in trying to save their customers some serious money but our contention has always been that the ryocmc experience is so superior that cost should not be an issue and cheap never should have been a promotional tool anyway yeah i hate the taxation schemes of both the feds and the states but as far as tobacco with moderate use of really good tobaccos consumption usually goes down anyway and will always remain a better value than any packaged cigarette  one state texas even went so far as to begin taxing all loose tobacco at  per ounce in response to this pipe versus cigarette tobacco debacle and the problem was exacerbated by certain retailers promoting the new pipe tobaccos for roll you own use people just cant keep their mouths shut it seems anyway it has effected some of our favorite tobaccos but those like stokkebye zigzag republic and commonwealth were smart enough or wealthy enough to keep their cigarette tobacco lines even if they decided to offer a pipe tobacco line as well stokkebye has been in the pipe tobacco business for very long time  generations and dr has all the qualifications to be a real pipe tobacco manufacturer dr practically controls the perique tobacco supply which is an important component in many historic pipe blends they have for a long time and still do use latakia in their blends another important pipe component and they changed the cut of their tobacco dramatically rather than simply repackaging as did some anyway this controversy will reach a head and eventually well all know where we stand and we certainly look forward to some kind of stability in the meantime stokkebye rules at the high end where most who really love tobacco should be and republic with top and gambler makes good cigarette cut offerings we all are familiar with the expanded tobacco strategy that gambler tube cut has adopted they still make regular gambler has some negatives and some positives it appears that premier has followed the same path but we need to see it to verify their original premier blends introduced a couple of years ago were really quite good our readers are torn as much as we are about expanded tobacco in canada i hated it while on a visit to ctc in  stephane david then from ctc and i went into a local tobacco store in toronto to buy some tobacco one of my favorites used to be export a and they had that as well as players and a few other brands of note and they all came in three sizes of plastic tubs each tub whether it was  inches tall or  inches tall or  held  grams what was that thats right it went from slightly expanded to reallllly expanded i bought a  and a  tub looked like a lot more tobacco in the  incher then i made a stick out the most expanded lasted  puffs and it was gone and the taste was significantly different than the lessnot expanded in the  incher i talked to a few patrons who absolutely refused to buy the big tubs after being burned a first time the point is the new tube cuts and superroll expanded blends from republic taste a whole lot more like nonexpanded gambler than i expected and the tube cut in both experiments we did here along with a friend who owns a bunch of tobacco shops in michigan who i trust scientifically found that an ounce of regular gambler would make about  sticks and an ounce of tube cut about  sticks max so its not that expanded which is why it tastes so much better than the expanded crap i found in canada years ago anyway well explore this more we have had numberof readers complain about the gambler tube cut nothing like the volume of complaints we had about the new polish mcclintock  but that is another story altogether that will be told when i return  there is much more politics to share on the tobacco issue for instance heres a teaser the world health organization who has published its tobacco atlas that has a lot of facts about tobacco consumption and where it is grown on one page of this atlas it makes the case weve been hammering on since our beginnings eleven years ago according to the who in  it took  pound of leaf tobacco to make  cigarettes by the year  it took only  pounds to make the same  sticks how you can even classify a packaged cigarette except for shermans and a very few others as tobacco is oxymoronic well show you the actual page when we get back as well as the misleading documents provided to congress by one of our favorite antitobacco nanny groups that caused the schip excise tax hike to go through the roof youre gonna love this trail of treachery  zigzag blends have improved continuously every year and now make some of the finest widely accessible tobacco out there there is much more to this story which we will share with you when we return but suffice it to say that with a can of zigzag dark blue you will enjoy yourself immensely oh yeah as far as why cigars keep getting a break it is not just the fat cats in dc liking cigars as many think although that is certainly a part of the equation sources tell us what should already be obvious the countries that provide most cigars and whose economies strongly depend on these exports to the us are very close geographically to hugo chavez and venezuela and of course cuba the us does not want to damage relations with central american south american and caribbean countries for fear they may once again as during the reagan administration  the contras begin to align against us having traveled quite a bit to those regions in the last few years north america is not particularly well thought of by many there it is interesting to note that cigars made here in the us miami mostly from components from the latin countries have more severe regulatory requirements than the imports again more specifics when we return in a week or so interesting to note that were informed that the most powerful lobbying group for the cigar industry in dc are the un ambassadors from the potentially affected countries we are still checking that one out but i would not doubt it for a minute and lastly remember that stokkebye is now villigerstokkebye and they make some truly kick ass as good as it gets cigars as well as the highest quality cigarette and pipe tobaccos in the world and organic smoke inc with their new kentucky select have finally bridged the gap between great taste and pure organic tobacco ive never tasted an organic blend like this it is absolutely delicious more on that blend as well  rolling papers this category is under almost as much attack right now as tobacco at least from the fda specifically flavored rolling papers have been made nearly illegal completely so for tobacco use is there a caveat there however the many purveyors of fine rolling papers still have much to be proud of fine rolling papers we have not spent a whole lot of time writing about the fact is that brands like bambu my go to papers for  years from the s on are every bit as cool as they ever were and remain one of my very favorite a tobacco or smoke shop without bambu papers is operating under false pretenses of course there will be no flavored versions but ive never been a fan of flavored papers no matter what i used to smoke or what i smoke today gizehs hamf hemp remain a favorite as do all of the zig zags republics ventura whites lights job and tribals are outstanding as are the joker series from commonwealthrba hbi continues its huge line of papers but our favorites remain the raw series as well as the really classy elements some now with magnetic closures  cool chris hill founder of chills is back with his outstanding island papers in truly dazzling packaging the cris line as well as the somewhat mystical nine dragons again none of these varied brands are flavored  not for tobacco use per fda current postions read into that what you will and we will explain in a week safe to say the rolling paper section has some comprehensive details to investigate and share as to the flavoring issue and ultimately the final rulings on the issue  tubes there are a few new tubes in addition to the vera cruz line which will include in the future not only a slim mm version in mm as well as ultimately a mm slim see the injector section now to see what that is about a new tube the beretta made in the same factory as the veracruz is another designer quality tube that is pure eye candy gizeh has had their newest mm filter element tube the silvertip extra out for a while and more people need to try it it is really nice with the expected benefits of the longer element one would expect there are some really cheapass tubes out there as well but after looking at them weve decided pretty much so what and of course the premier line and the top and gambler and zigzag lines are always good values and easily found much more on the whole tube picture much more important to the future of this industry than you might expect plus a new pipe that replaces the much missed tattoo its called the cigapipe from an australian company by the name of piparette it comes in two versions both much smaller than the original tattoo and far better for the cigarette smoker the high tech filter is much more effective than any weve seen in any pipe to date the evolution series of the cigapipe is a well made traditional pocket pipe with an incredible filter that smokes really nicely the autoloader version has a tobacco reservoir that many will find useful as with most other categories in this industry innovation is excitingly energetic and continuing to increase in intensity  injectors march  here the story really gets exciting please note there is already some new stuff at the top of the injector section the powermatic ii the new easy roller from simron with variable speed control the casspin closer and more while the industry in general has been bombarded with legislation and regulation enough to drive any sane person to the nearest drug store the innovation in injectors continues to accelerate a slim tube crankstyle from simron the exp is on the way and could likely change this industry in very big ways the video and the review of the prototype is already in the current injector section republic has gone delorean with the incredible looking t version of the already well respected topomatic as well as republics little red saucer shaped gambler injector think short throw manual sports car shifter which weve had a year to try and break and have failed to do so the supermatic and excel remain intact and superb however one thing that we must mention driven both by a lot of mail from readers and our own experiences the newer larger pipe cuts are much harder on injectors and consequently we do not recommend them for injecting yeah they will go into the tube but they burn much less smoothly and evenly than cigarette cut tobacco and again they put a lot of stress on the injector the fact being that moisture content is ten times more important than ever before with these new cuts to keep from breaking your injector frankly if it says pipe tobacco on the package i smoke it in a pipe ill share with you my rather elite collection of pipes that ive had and smoked for years and this new pipe tobacco especially some of the dr blends are downright outstanding in a pipe we also have a new design for a pipe under development that may make the transition if necessary easier for those who choose pipe tobacco over cigarette cut more on that as well there are a couple of very noteworthy electrics there is an electric that has undergone a lot of tweaking since we first saw it a few months ago the designermanufacturer has gone to great pains to work out the kinks and we have huge hope that this will be a real winner it is small electric and uses a spoon and works now as well as it looks cool there are older versions of this machine the powermaticii out there but we suggest you wait for the latest version which we now have for testing it is far superior to its earlier iterations for some it may be the best electric out there for now and recently we began to feel that it may be the best spoon injector period the magnum is finished and but for the down turn in the economy it would be available now it uses a gear driven steel rod they lost the batteries and this thing will inject anything that will fit through its nozzle including rocks we have one of the only two existing prototypes here and will show it in detail when we return the push rod design is still the ultimate strategy and tsp really pulled out the stops on this final design incredibly powerful planetary motor engaging a direct gear drive its awesome but will be more expensive than the original projections for the original magnum but legal and financial hoops still have to be navigated and finally simrons new easyroller is doing some great injections and is priced right their new auger and slower speed motor is really changing our views os the potential of auger type injectors for the future a high quality video of both the powermaticii and the easy roller is on the injectors page be patient you will be rewarded with any of these machines the injector world is really looking great  rollers there are a couple of new rollers worthy of notice the existing ones are all damn good but hbi has made the effort to make a roller made from really futuristic and more natural materials and there is a metal roller that is the best roller i have ever seen that was sent to us for our evaluation we wont say by whom but it was a very large company the problem is that we loved it said so did a personal dvd for the manufacturer with our highest recommendations and yet until we get to vegas we wont know if they actually decided to bring it into the us it is very popular in the uk and if they dont have it by now im sure someone else hint will pick up on the design barring patent infringements of course  grow your own we did our first article on growing your own tobacco in july of  here is the link it was obvious to us then that the day may come when a very large number of people would begin to see the benefits and perhaps even necessity of becoming tobacco gardeners we are a hell of a lot closer now than ever before jim johnson still reigns supreme in knowledge that he shares with the public about growing tobacco and what seeds to get his site referenced in the  article remains httpwwwseedmancom  we have each year grown small plots of tobacco just to continually retain and expand our personal knowledge of the best practices to achieve success in this endeavor it really is quite easy and the satisfaction one always derives from doing things for oneself combined now with the more severe economicpolitical component makes this absolutely the time to begin if youve not already started plants can be grown in pots in small garden plots or in many cases even indoors the amount of production possible for ones own use a very strong caveat is astounding with little effort a little knowledge and some good seed hbi is now selling a few varieties of seeds but the seedman site has hundreds of every kind of tobacco one could hope for and again no one knows more than johnson about seeds and personal growing endeavors when i return well will show you the results of this past summers plantings we think you will be stunned as to the production and the ease at which it can be achieved and remember our goal as far as grow your own is not to hurt the great manufacturers of fine tobacco it is an insurance policy against a government that has been rotted to the core by special interest groups and others who have taken it upon themselves to force you to live like they do growing ones own tobacco may provide the ultimate hedge against such intrusions  last thing you hear the word corrupt or corruption a lot lately please remember that this word not only applies to monetary greed or political chicanery its true meaning is rotting and decaying and that we should find even more of a danger to our country and ourselves personally than all the wall street gambling casinos combined from a rotten core the corruption will spread to engulf the entire organism and the only treatment when that happens is amputation we have the peaceful and legal means of performing this amputation career politicians and lobbyists must be removed but if we wait too long the corruption could be irreversible we have before us a severe case of gangrene in this country and all of you know the ultimate consequence of ignoring that  and what can be really done you may ask the following has been at the bottom of this cover page for eight  years it holds as an exercise in logic as much today as has it always once again  our position on tobacco  it is our position that because of the sheer enormity of money that is involved in the tobacco debate and the fact that such vast amounts of resource can breed fraud and corruption as evidenced by the large number of claims of violations attributed to the cigarette industry as well as counterclaims of fraudulent research methods by those on the other side of the issue much more needs to be done to quantify the specific elements of tobacco smoke as well as specific elements of other sources of smoke and pollution in our environment that can lead to health problems we therefore stress as a logical and necessary step forward in order to ameliorate the controversy and lessen the divisive nature of the subject that any and all tax revenues that are collected on tobacco as well as all punitive damages collected on behalf of us citizens by all local state and federal litigations against tobacco other than those funds already allocated that are needed to satisfy current regulation and enforcement be applied to five  areas of investigation and compensation exclusively these areas are  scientifically rigorous comprehensive research on tobacco and health with full public disclosure detailing the accounting for the amount of research money distributed of how decisions are reached as to the ways and means said research money is distributed and to whom the research money is awarded and why  full disclosure and complete public dissemination of information on experimental methodology and subsequent findings that are validated by the oversight of nonpartisan scientifically qualified panels that are accountable to the taxpayers by way of unimpeded public scrutiny and debate  all revenues allocated to any of the above as well as to the subsequent health care of individuals who may be found damaged by tobacco or to education programs for tobacco intervention must be used in a costefficient manner as determined by full disclosure and reasonable consensus between these scientifically qualified panels and representatives of those who bear the burden of taxation  during the above research phase should other sources of polluting elements in our environment be found to be significant factors in the symptomatic expression of illnesses previously attributed solely to tobacco use that those other entities found culpable be held fiscally accountable to the degree determined by the same scientifically qualified panels with suitable restitution to the tobacco taxpayers for previous unwarranted tax burdens as a consequence  additionally be it found that institutions or individuals have purposely for profit or gain of status misstated or overstated the impact or role of tobacco usage in the symptomatic expression of certain illnesses those found culpable of purposeful deception for profit or manipulative power be held fiscally accountable to the maximum degree determined by the same scientifically qualified panels with likewise suitable restitution to the specific taxpayers as a consequence in conjunction with the strong possibility of criminal prosecution for fraud for those for any type of gain who have been blatantly disingenuous with fact  there you have it a pretty comprehensive taste of what the completed new issue of ryo magazine will look like with few edits remaining and a little verification as mentioned above it will begin to show up within a week of our returning right now there is a lot of new stuff on the injectors page and the rollingpapers page to keep you interested and to prepare you for what youve read above  in the meantime if you have not read what is below please do so there is a wealth of information there that remains timely and is in reality even more important to your daily lives than the products we review in fact if current trends continue unabated by people like you and me all products we love in every product sector will face regulations unlike those seen in even the most repressive societies in history and grand schemes supposedly in the public interest that in reality are only cash cows for the few must be seen for what they in fact are it really is in your hands so take another look below enjoy for the impatient click here to see how our precious fda now in control of tobacco conducts its business its like reading a bad novel that is yet compelling simply because of its lack of focus or path you cant put it down because you naively remain certain that surely it will eventually make sense and that something some thing will justify the effort good luck more very soon  doug  this issue has been one of the most difficult to finish since our first issue nearly eleven years ago more on that a lot more in a moment first off though if you have a broadband internet connection check out the multimedia site and send your friends andor customers there who may have questions about the myoryo methodology there are comprehensive videos covering all aspects of the experience and there will be a lot more coming in the future we are concentrating heavily on this visual aspect as it answers a lot of questions in a very straightforward manner  a manner that seems to be pervasive in our society where reading is becoming somewhat of a lost art for whatever reason it is essential that those cigarette smokers interested in perhaps migrating from the obsessive behavior of packaged cigarettes get a clear understanding of the advantages of myoryo and these many advantages far outweigh simply cost savings few retailers actively demonstrate the method this we know from a lot of readers especially those new to myo who have expressed amazement at the utility of the process we got far too many letters daily from folks who were confused as to what myoryo is they are intimidated by the term injection and we have had more than a few questions like is injecting tobacco better than smoking it that at least for those that have access to broadband thus the videos has been eliminated for the most part for those that dont the questions persist the multimedia site speaks for itself and we hope adult readers old and new enjoy it it will grow as new questions come in and as new products emerge whose advantages can best benefit from visual demonstration mac users will need the latest windows media player plugin for mac easily obtained by clicking here windows users will need the latest windows media video  as well all easily obtained at the preceding link  now on to this new issue this magazine was initially created to show not only the cigarette smoking public the advantages of myoryocmc and to highlight what we felt and still feel are the best products available but as importantly to demonstrate and warn of the direction our country and others are taking to satisfy special interest groups in every possible sector of life at the expense of our freedoms ryo has always meant more to me as a statement of personal choice and independence than simply an acronym for a superior method of enjoying tobacco this is the largest most comprehensive issue to date it is our intent to make subsequent issues more concise and return to our quarterly schedule we have a lot of product to show you in this issue and have already accumulated a lot more for the upcoming issue which will be ready in early august after the rtda show we do periodic updates to current issues and in this one one particular area should not be overlooked as many of you know we have been traveling extensively this last year both in the us and abroad this magazine is read in well over  countries and our travels reflect the interest in cmc myo worldwide   now again along with showing our readers product it was even from its early beginnings our intention to make tobacco enthusiasts aware of the politics of smoking in general these politics could well be defined as both regulatory and health related and our main thrust in these areas has always been quality moderation and public activism seeking the truth about tobacco has been of primary concern the economy of the method has never been our point cheap cigarettes and cheap tobacco carry baggage that when used as the sole reason for moving to ryomyo will ultimately destroy the real tobacco industry and those who enjoy great tobacco will lose any reasonable access to it and as most know by now our concern is for the often illdefined differences between the cigarette industry and the tobacco industry we have never encouraged readers to smoke and we have been highly aggressive in our belief that if one chooses to smoke use the best tobacco you can buy and use it sparingly  like a good wine  what has taken so long to put this issue together lies mostly in the domain of the rapidly changing regulatory and political situation that engulfs tobacco while most of the regulations we now have and will speak of supposedly were aimed at cigarettes most all of them for various special interest group reasons have landed squarely on the back of the rolling tobacco industry as well before we begin what may be a rather disconcerting journey for some we want to make it clear that this page will outline the problems and some of the reasons for them in the editorial section you will find our best extrapolations of both solutions and what in the very near future given some intelligent and logical application of easily instituted possibilities the rollingmake your own industry could look like in the future youll notice that we refrain from using the phrase stuff your own it sounds egregiously ignorant and the acronym syo is even worse than myo we even had a contest you can read about in the review section that addressed our efforts to come up with a better descriptor of all that make your own is and can be basically custom made cigarettes whereby those who truly enjoy tobacco have absolute control over the content of their smokes there is no shortage of new products in this issue but most of them have arrived rather late in the context of the originally intended date of this issue we wanted to have a chance to evaluate all of them extensively before passing the information on to our readers so again theres a lot to see in this issue so why is this cover piece so long overdue read it and youll see why  before proceeding we strongly recommend the two books shown at above left and at right the book tobacco is an incredible treatise on perhaps the most controversial plant ever to grace the planet more on it is in the tobacco section but it is a must read for all in order to put the current tobacco controversy in striking historical perspective crichtons state of fear is a definitive look at what drives nearly all things intrusive into our personal lives including the antitobacco movement while its plot focuses on the junk science of global warming its principles applies to antitobacco strategies as well the point is not whether global warming is occurring the point is that it is big business as is antitobacco and frankly the profits generated from managing these two threats are not only enormous trillions of dollars but these profits are the sole reason for the existence of these organized purveyors of doom global warming may be a fact but there is no profit in it being a natural earth cycle the big profit arises if it can be blamed on entities with deep pockets  like manufacturers the energy industry or suv makers im frankly a bit surprised some bright bulb with some financial angle hasnt already accused smokers of contributing to excess so called greenhouse gases as well we need to look at reality not rhetoric there is even research out there that is showing that trees and vegetation in general produce a lot of methane a major greenhouse gas along with the much welcomed oxygen there have been many warming and cooling cycles that have impacted the earth for many hundreds of millions of years global warming alarmists fail to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the current condition is solely manmade we agree that the benchmark for reasonable doubt should be relatively low considering the global consequences if man actually were to have sole responsibility and control over this phenomena even such a lowered threshold has not been reached an example of how dumb these protagonists are and how dumb or gullible they assume the general public to be can be found in the film the day after tomorrow there the lead character has a paleoclimate model that needs to be called into use to help understand and predict the further progression of the sudden climate change that is devastating the earths populations in a speech at a global warming conference near the beginning of the film as well as several other times in the film when explaining the efficacy of his model he stresses it is based on a paleoclimatological event that happened  years ago obviously he is admitting quite early in the film that such a dramatic climate change happened well before humans were capable of the pollution that he blames for the current crisis both critics and advocates of the film seem to have missed this vital point it speaks as well to the core of the antitobacco movements excuse for their excesses and that is the differences between a casual relationship a causal relationship click here for a decent though somewhat circular look at this favorite term of the epidemiologist and a directly attributable definitively sole cause the first is a weak possible relationship the second only a little stronger possibility that a thing may likely be a factor in a given outcome and the third is by definition the only cause jumping off a  foot cliff onto rocks is logically the sole cause of a death whether the person smoked or not all but the last are merely todays version of mammoth flatulence  read steve milloys column linked below to see just how silly and dangerous this kind of narrow thinking can become especially when it attempts to lay blame for situations that may have entirely different causes some of which may be just as preventable by simpler means i must repeat that the science is still not conclusive as to the cause of what appears at least to be a climatic change perhaps al gore is right perhaps it is human intervention even though it has happened frequently before humans could have been the cause its not that the theory itself is the culprit intelligent and creative humans and the science that results from such beings are an essential part of our own evolution the problem is not with the creative or inventive pure scientists the problem is how those not qualified to interpret the science choose to use parts of any scientific theory as a launching pad for their own agenda which is almost always profit motivated again read another milloy article at the link here you will be amazed and probably not too hard pressed to see how certain groups may be able to profit enormously if what you read about comes to pass a hint  think chemical companies that make fertilizer  now if global warming opportunists could prove that humans and their machines were the only cause of global warming or even the leading causality we would be well advised to listen and change our behavior and you can bet strict laws to assist us in doing so would be quickly forthcoming and widely accepted however since historically the earth has expressed this global warming disease if you follow the analogy before and well before the machinery of humans one must take great care in accessing responsibility lest we overlook perhaps other more important factors and waste a lot of resources money following a literally dead end trail read steven milloys junsksciencecom latest in a long line of criticisms involving the huge cost of the kyoto treaty and the tiny amount of impact this multibillion eventually multitrillion dollar boondoggle is estimated and even admitted to eventually have click here for the article and note the archives at the immediate right on the page you will be taken to read all the articles on various subjects they contain vital information regarding all kinds of pseudoscience scams in fact make wwwjunksciencecom one of your bookmarks what you will find there is what weve been telling readers for years about the highly profitable business of pseudoscientific fear mongering the article on the kyoto anniversary is shocking to the extreme and it appears now the kyoto treaty to have been predominantly an experiment to see if humanity could be coerced to support the high profit geopolitical science of environmental activism no matter how weak the actual science behind any of it may be yes we have been poor stewards of our planet but we need real solutions not imaginary ones that enormously profit the very few and wind up accomplishing little or nothing other than the redistribution of wealth from the producers of the world to the nonproductive and puritanical nannies  much in the same context were tobacco to be proven to be the sole cause of all the diseases it is blamed for the public health establishment which is often a job creation service for those who lack the skills to do anything else truly useful for the health of humankind and make money at it would be howling to make tobacco illegal just like any other proven dangerously toxic substance a bit below you will see what that establishment feels about completely banning tobacco and their accomplices the antismoking pharmaceutical legal and lobbying interests of all involved would have no choice but to join in the eradication efforts but again their unidirectional frenzy over tobacco creates the risk of overlooking something perhaps far more dangerous in our environment the american cancer society has no cures for cancer and conventional medicine understands the parameters of the disease only a little better than it did  years ago but wheres the moneyprofit in an as of yet unknown cause one would have to spend money to find that unknown factor not extort it from a single sector of the population and they would have to use the money on the project not on everything but in reality if tobacco were banned none of these groups would have income or jobs afterwards unless of course they could find another cash cow to rape and the fact is they already have obesity as mentioned below is look at a piece of legislation attempted in north dakota a while back read it and then reconsider the true aims of public health departments the antitobacco coalitions including acs aha and socalled other disease prevention organizations and of course the pharmaceuticals and other interests that fund them and profit even more from them simultaneously  it is an interesting fact that during the great black plague in the middle of the last millenium the equivalent of the public health system circa s decided that rats were the cause of this plague that was initially killing a few hundreds of europeans their brightly narrow and quick fix solution was to exterminate all the rats by doing so the fleas that were the true carriers of the plague were forced to find a new host other than the rats the fleas selected humans which resulted ultimately in the deaths of as many as an estimated hundred million people politically these health bureaucrats had much to gain from finding a fast solution  someone or something to blame  and who likes rats anyway  or smokers for that matter heroes they would be in the same way justice officials from investigators to das make political hay by quickly solving crimes front page stuff even if only to find later they hung the wrong man page eight news at best the medieval interesting word midevil solution killing the rats let loose the plague and magnified the tragedy exponentially if we apply the highly flexible to be kind techniques of epidemiology using terms like casual causal and cause we would wind up with something like this for a time the rats were thought to be the cause of the plague however even if this were true the actual cause of death was a pneumonia like illness more specifically the respiratory system shut down along with a very high fever like the cliff jumper above the actual cause of any death is either cessation of brain function which is still debated re schiavo or the heart stops whatever the reason for this to happen the actual cause of death is one of those two things  this is further demonstrated in homicide forensics by the examiners coroner preoccupation with specifics for instance if a body is found dead in the water but has a bullet hole in it it is always the job of the forensic pathologist to determine if the dead person died before or after entering the water this is highly relevant to future prosecution of the case and to the penalty the guilty party will receive it is too bad that epidemiologists who make up these inane statistics about everything that has a financial benefit to some public health group remember the  obesity related deaths reported by the cdc just last year that was subsequently downgraded at least three times arriving finally at a little over  dont do the work of pathologists to find out what is really killing people further down you will hear dr ronald natale in the larry king interview state that we really dont know how cancer kills or how tobacco smoke causes cancer natale goes on to say that the organs of those who die from cancer are often in quite good shape the forensic pathologist if they were involved in these studies would likely find many possible reasons for the persons death and smoking would be absolutely a casual association at best no doubt people do die in part because they smoke natale mentions one out of eight smokers get cancer mostly lung cancer which by inference leaves out all the other forms of cancer that tobacco is blamed for a true causal as opposed to casual relationship according to an epidemiologist would require all smokers to get lung cancer therefore by the very fact that all smokers dont get sick even causality must be defined as a rather weak association now ive studied quite a bit of the research done on lab animals regarding carcinogens to be classified as a carcinogen a substance must cause a tumor in a lab animal mostly rats and mice even the most carcinogenic compound tested dont cause these tumors in all of the subjects and each research project differs as to how many of a group must be so afflicted to satisfy the predetermined test results they seek  the antitobacco public health establishment endangers us in the same way that the plague medicos did  years ago they focus on tobacco only and search no further for what may be the real cause of cancer or even what cancer really is in its widely varying forms or any other pernicious human ailments for that matter to a degree that will prove beyond a doubt the other or actual causes those other causes have no money to conveniently extract heard that before but it bears repeating and this lack of intelligent use of existing scientific tools preferring the weak science of statistical analysis epidemiology is causing the same knee jerk reaction with the avian bird flu youve heard so much about lately rather than find ways to manage or actually kill the pathogen the virus or even better create immunity from all viruses they are simply killing the birds now viruses are not unlike fleas they both need hosts they are parasites and eradicating one host will only lead to the the viruses search for another and viruses are much better at this than are fleas they can change symbiotic sources in a matter of a couple of days in the world of virology its referred to as mutation but it is really adaptation and the science of mutation is understood or at least appreciated hardly better than  years ago at least in its overall ramifications better isolate but leave some of the birds alive and figure out how to kill the virus without killing the host  certainly before you at minimum know the degree of risk of viral host upgrading ultimately when one talks about organisms being good at finding new hosts one must only look to the antieverything litigation movement for a perfect example too bad a vaccine has not been developed to combat this group of parasites  look at it this way the american cancer society and other such groups with the possible exception of nci  the national cancer institute that actually has done some cutting edge science on the possible viral and genetic components of cancer with its many billions of dollars has come up with no solution to any cancers other than early diagnosis surgery based on early diagnosis radiation oh yeah can you say further mutation and new cancers and drugs financial windfalls of epic proportions for pharmaceuticals even though the chemo is often so toxic it can kill you almost as fast as the original cancer all highly profitable short term exercises for certain groups of businesses including nonprofits with really no need to be successful to the degree that any other normal product producer must after all the victim is already dying from cancer  right the medical related profits and costs continue to soar of course the main focus of late the prohibitionist activity in other words things not to do rather than any positive activity has its own hugely profitable rewards as well  rewards that feed the other four regimen groups quite nicely and justify more revenue gathering through increased taxes and lawsuits public health professionals hah professionals  the third oldest profession  witch doctors  after hookers and spiritual leaders  before even lawyers and publiclyprivately funded nonprofits like the cancer society and the lung association who pay their leaders enormous salaries and are required to spend only  of all money theyve amassed on their missions have everything to gain from maintaining the problem the nonprofit racket no overstatement is possible here is finally getting some well deserved criminal attention as is the loyal order of money grubbing scum bag lobbyists lomgsbl there arent enough jails to hold them all if it would come to that  now even with all the money involved aside for a moment we emphasize once again the sheer folly and danger of making presumptions as to disease causation for years weve been emphasizing the difference between tobacco and cigarettes they are two different things one is a natural substance the other a chemically formulated artificial product even more important perhaps is what is used in the growing and manufacture of tobacco and especially in products that cigarette makers heavily use like reconstituted tobacco sheet tobacco has been around a long time it has been both friend and foe to humans intermittently through out its history read the book mentioned above tobacco  please even the american cancer society concedes that lung cancer was relatively rare before the birth of manufactured cigarettes they attributed this solely to the fact that manufactured cigarettes made it easier for people to smoke nonetheless it should be clear that even before the first manufactured cigarette was produced a lot of people used tobacco that is clearly why cigarette companies emerged to satisfy and enhance an existing market like the poor scientific methodology of the great plague era these so called charitable health groups have trouble with facts because they fail to look for real facts instead they look for a single villain one with deep pockets ignoring all alternatives and nuances that make up the real world of threat analysis they use the terms tobacco and cigarettes interchangeably a practice weve been trying to clarify and change since our first publication many in the scientific community understand that pesticides and other garbage that finds its way into cigarettes may likely be a much more strident culprit than the tobacco plant itself now there is no doubt that most tobacco for reasons of crop yield has been exposed to pesticides of one kind or another natural or not check out the following link here it keeps moving around on the acs site so if it becomes inactive go to the american cancer society site and search for risk factors for lung cancer radon  radon which is a naturally occurring gas from natural uranium decay in our environment has long been linked to lung cancer to what degree is still uncertain and since there is little profit in more definitive assessments except for the proliferating radon intervention companies which like the asbestos irradication attempts of a decade or more ago often prove to make the problem worse not better radon is given minor consideration that may be a serious mistake as serious as blaming tobacco seemingly for all the ills of mankind the simple solution as to radon for which there are already maps provided by satellite imaging  for maps by state and for the us in total click here would be to see how the lung cancer rate that is attributed to smokers is geographically distributed and then compare that to each areas naturally occurring radon levels unfortunately there is little profit potential in simple solutions and the fact that radon and smoking may explain why certain people get lung cancer and others dont would fly in the face of the pseudoscience that generates obscenely large profits for the antismoking establishment again there is no one to sue over radon  it occurs naturally  for now lets just look at the following provided on the epa environmental protection agency website regarding radon also on that site you can find maps again click here of radon distribution in the us and begin to wonder as do we how many of the high radon areas have larger rates of lung cancer that are now solely attributed to cigarette smoking what is most interesting about what follows is the admission from the epa as to the methodology of risk assessment for both radon and how it applies to the same statistical models that were used to invent tobacco and health data if you look hard enough in this world you will find contradictions to everything that public health claims you dont have to read between the lines or read from sites that are at odds with the public health community again this is from the epa and you can begin to access the entire wealth of information by clicking here and scroll to the top of the page the link takes you this below is only an excerpt from a very robust site on radon and risk assessment so make sure you read the entire page this link takes you to quote to have a reasonable certainty in the conclusions many thousands of cases are required to detect the increased risk of lung cancer due to radon this is because the more things that cause a disease the harder it is to separate one cause from another thus it takes many cases to pinpoint the risk from each separate cause the us public health service radon experts estimate that  to  cases and twice as many controls would be needed to conduct a definitive epidemiologic study of residential radon lung cancer risk the residential studies conducted to date have all included between  and  cases and thus have been too small to provide conclusive information some years ago this same process was used to detect an increased risk of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking it took many years of study to make the positive link between the cause and effect of smoking and lung cancer most of the increased lung cancer risk is attributable to smoking through mathematical modeling the research process for smoking was very laborious however radons process is even more challenging because radons contribution to increased lung cancer risk  is difficult to see against the large background of lung cancer due to other causes which include smoking asbestos some heavy metals and other types of radiation ie detecting radonrelated lung cancer is like trying to detect a  increase of sand on a beach already full of sand finally it is difficult to accurately determine radon exposures in residential settings since we are estimating past exposures from current measurements the number of required study participants increases with the difficulty in determining the exposure we already have a wealth of scientific data on the relationship between radon exposure and the development of lung cancer the scientific experts agree that the occupational miner data is a very solid base from which to estimate risk of lung cancer deaths annually while residential radon epidemiology studies will improve what we know about radon they will not supersede the occupational data health authorities like the centers for disease control cdc the surgeon general the american lung association the american medical association and others agree that we know enough now to recommend radon testing and to encourage public action when levels are above  pcil the most comprehensive of these efforts has been the national academy of sciences biological effects of ionizing radiation beir vi reportthis report reinforces that radon is the secondleading cause of lung cancer and is a serious public health problemas in the case of cigarette smoking it would probably take many years and rigorous scientific research to produce the composite data needed to make an even more definitive conclusion end quote please remember that the above report was the work of the national academy of sciences and funded by the epa in the end both are funded by you i know reading this long pdf will give most brain pain but it is important to see the manipulative steps these kinds of epidemiological imitations of scientific research use to prove a point by the way as to the nonprofit status of the nas its president bruce alberts was pulling down over  dollars per year in fact there are many high paid officers working within this organization we provide an excerpt for their form  below you can see the whole thing as well as any nonprofit salaries at guidestarorg membership is free and when you begin searching your favorite charity for salaries you will quickly come to understand that these for the good organizations are mostly for the officers and directors whether it be the girls scouts whose head pulls down well over  per year or the others that will be noted above the nonprofit scam is the single biggest threat to our economy  after reading the above pay particular note to a statement found on the american cancer societies site see the acs link just above the beginning of this radon section and see how it differs dramatically from the epa information the acs site states recently concerns have been raised about houses in some parts of the united states built over soil with natural uranium deposits that can create high indoor radon levels studies from these areas have found that the risk of lung cancer may be doubled or even tripled if you have lived for many years in a radoncontaminated house this is a very small increase though when it is compared to the lung cancer risk from tobacco the shelby amendment httpwwwcatoorgpubspaspapdf  the shelby amendment which weve discussed in previous issues was created to provide a watchdog element on supposedly scientific research that results in regulations and laws click here for a short overview and above for greater detail of the amendment itself and why it is so vital this amendment be enforced the research community does not like this amendment to the freedom of information act they whine that it implies that we dont trust them well    i dont   especially when their findings have not only been proven wrong in some cases long after regulations and litigation based on their findings have already done their damage but most importantly when the researchers themselves have vested financial interests in the outcomes of a given research project drug companies the fda and the epa are especially unhappy about shelby which should be all the reason you need to encourage its rigorous enforcement when drug companies push the efficacy of certain cessation drugs these same drugs can become the basis for regulations how well for example with the new drug varenicline touted by its maker to be more effective than previous smoking cessation drugs the antitobacco movement immediately jumps on this as both a source of revenue for themselves which often comes from the drug maker itself in return for the antismoking group recommending its use and as yet another reason to push the idea that smoking is hard to kick and therefore should be taxed even more heavily and regulated even more aggressively people who have been smoking moderate amounts of real tobacco have almost no problem quitting if they really want to even those addicted to packaged cigarettes can quit if they really want to people are not as weak as the public health community or the pharmaceutical industry would have them believe and the constant dogma about how hard it is to quit is counterproductive for those who wish to quit  the problem with most smokers is that they really dont want to quit they enjoy the experience it is often for many much more of a recreational pleasure than a chemical dependency again at least for those whove used moderate amounts of real tobacco even pfizers the manufacturer of chantix  the commercial name for varenicline research studies show that on average  of smokers quit for the one year trial while  of those given zyban the other nonnicotine cessation drug were able to quit in the same tests about  given placebos were able to quit while these numbers may seem significant to some they are provided with absolutely no contextual look into the the lives and personalities of the subjects were the   who quit with placebo only therapy stronger willed than the other groups did the placebo effect have any relationship with those that were actually given the real stuff these kinds of questions are what the shelby amendment is intended to address if it is not obvious yet to you why we need oversight keep in mind that most of what folks hear about prescription drugs is fed to them by the drug companies themselves journalists have become lazy ap and upi reporters stringers now basically provide press releases fed to them by representatives of pharma companies for instance the ap story that first appeared in most newspapers big and small regarding varenicline chantix was as follows smoking the leading cause of preventable death worldwide is a critical public health imperative that takes an extraordinary toll on health care systems in the united states alone the cost of treating smokingrelated diseases is an estimated  billion a year said karen katen pfizer vice chairman and president pfizer human health the priority review designation for champix underscores the significant patient need for new therapies that will reduce the health burden of smoking no reporter in any story i could find went further than the press release not even to ask katen questions on the specific results of medical trials as far as im concerned those ap and upi stringers are no more than mouthpieces for the pharmaceutical industry they are not even close to being journalists  if you search online for nicorette gum you will find a large number of sites especially forums that in large part stress that the addiction created by these nicotine replacement products is quite problematic do these newer nonnicotine cessation products have side effects you bet they do and they are often more severe than the minor cravings one might face when one is dedicated to quitting and these drugs  all of them  are really expensive high profit items for drug makers none of these questions are asked or answered in drug research studies and there is really no oversight in the fda hearing process that approve a drug for use as you will see if you read the fda hearing documents regarding iressa that we highlight further down fda hearings have no counter argument provided by anyone the fda listens to representatives of the drug companies to researchers employed by the drug companies and to a handful of patients who claim to have been helped by the drug in question read the document on fda iressa hearings we provide the link here as well to this complete transcript of the proceedings its long but highly instructive as to the weakness of the fda process most especially when drugs are given a fast track approval based on how badly society needs a drug in most cases the fast track seemingly has more to do with the size of the pharmaceutical company offering the drug  not all drug companies are monsters and all drug companies have many times provided needed help to those who suffer what we want to note regarding them is that the temptation from the huge profits derived from drug manufacturing is overwhelming for even those of high moral fiber where there is high profit there must be oversight especially when some the profits are used to create legislation that makes the use of the product nearly a requirement to the eye of the consumer this the shelby amendment addresses but unfortunately to date there have been almost no reported uses of the power of this amendment read more on the wwwcatoorg website regarding this and other interesting attempts to oversee all kinds of politicaleconomiclegislativeenvironmentalpublic health and nonprofit boondoggles the msa master settlement agreement  the american legacy foundation set up by naag the attorneys generals national association that forged the  state master settlement agreement as part of that agreement has well over a billion dollars in its kitty yet it pleads for more funding while spending a mere  million per year on its mission including salaries and percs its ceo cheryl healton a couple of years ago took out a near million dollar personal mortgage loan secured by the foundation for a home in fact it would be in your best interest to go to the american legacy site wwwamericanlegacyorg and under the link about us look at their financial statements you simply must do this if you want the knowledge necessary to cast intelligent votes in the future for those that state they are unwilling to further support this growing scandal the personal loan mentioned above is at note j about page  under loan to officer  the page numbers appear in acrobat as you scroll the right side slider button down and just above that is an incredibly generous life insurance policy that is paid for by the foundation but owned ultimately by ceo healton the current financials  to save you time can be found at httpamericanlegacyorgamericanlegacyfilepersistenceauditiedfssummarypdf  the previous years financial statement where they received their last large payment from the tobacco settlement about  which they received ever year from  to  can be found by clicking the link for  financials again after you go to the about us financials link reading these documents may take a little effort on your part but you will find many interesting things there theyve done with all that money including lots of vehicles and a ton of investing both here and abroad to maintainincrease their financial power those who are adept at understand accounting should let us know their opinions of what they see there however even the layperson will see things there that have little to do with their mission  which is ostensibly to curtail youth smoking which is once again on the rise even with all the money spent so far to intervene  read through the whole thing remember all the amounts are in thousands ie if it says  it means  after these people got their initial  million from the first msa payment in  they began investing it here and all over the world the interest they receive alone on these massive investments is often greater than the amount they spend on the programs they are chartered to support in fact over  billion dollars in investment transactions were conducted no doubt their financial advisor fees of over  million per year were justified the numbers are huge and complex as is the financial document itself you can hide a lot in a large and complicated space they spend again over  million per year on financial investment advice alone you would be well advised to see where your msa tobacco settlement money is going  so read it youll need acrobat reader to read the pdfs  in all fairness we do compliment this organization for at least supplying this information on their site as for most nonprofits financial disclosures one must contact the irs or walk into the nonprofits office to get their form  to obtain this information the s are more detailed as to specific salaries and other items and anyone can request and get them if you do it through the mail with the irs you have to pay a small fee and there are redactions  if you walk in their front door they must give it to you free of charge or for a small copying fee and the information is more complete you will also find that even though this organization was initially well funded again  million the first year and  of your tobacco money for the next four years  an expense that the pertinent cigarette companies simply passed on to the smoker they still found it necessary to take out two  million loans and another  million loan a bit later to fund expenses why because they put most of the initial money in variousterm investments or property the fact that the lawyers at naag are supposedly overseeing this operation leaves me with little confidence in their oversight even though two of its members always sit on the legacy board currently they get about  million per year from tobacco you can see the section of the msa agreement where the funding for this organization is outlined at this link click here you will also see that they all benefactors and participants of the msa had a very specific mission and certain restrictions on attacking the tobacco industry many lawsuits have evolved from the latter in acrobat pdf files the pages of interest as to this foundation which has had several names including the nation education foundation the master settlement agreement foundation and ultimately the american legacy foundation are pages  as numbered in the document itself however in acrobat they are  some pages that are indexes and tables of contents are not numbered in the original document but acrobat counts them anyway on page  of the actual document is the heading establishment of a national foundation this is your starting point  and here using oregons fairly current regulatory attempts as an example is the same kind of data that was used by the various  states to justify the lawsuits that resulted in the eventual msa settlement you can find much more information on this state specific legislation and the numbers game employed by clicking here part of the pagesection is reproduced below note that this link is to the state of oregons dhs  department of human services in other words the public health department website public money was spent to put it up and the law it supports is a legislative activity not one that the voters had any say in it is representative of the kinds of tactics number gymnastics used over the many years by the states in order to justify their portion of the msa money and to justify their prohibitionist policies which in the end serve ultimately to justify their revenue raising by taxes and lawsuits look at the numbers below and realize that most of the so called costs of smoking to the state even if one were to believe that the numbers themselves were anything other than extrapolated modeled  refer to the section above regarding radon studies for more on modeling for profit and skewed data clearly shows that the state itself admits to spending  million in direct medical expenditures not the  billion in the headline and even that number includes federal money the percentage of which they conveniently leave out as you can see most of the estimated cost again the word estimated leaves a lot of wiggle room with it seems no verification required was borne by insurance and cost paid by individuals and most telling even the bulk of that cost estimate was based on such nebulous statistical forays as indirect costs of lost productivity due to illness and indirect costs due to premature deaths the latter being the largest slice of the pie both are clearly estimates with absolutely no real data possible to support such claims these are precisely the kinds of estimated numbers that the states were using to sue the large cigarette manufacturers that resulted in the msa settlement these numbers remain the excuse for the states not to spend the bulk of revenues extracted from smokers since the  msa settlement on anything remotely related to tobacco intervention or health care for those who may claim damage from smoking packaged cigarettes the states continue to emphasize their need to pay back all of the past lost revenue due to smoking related health care rather than use the money for current programs at the bottom the last line of this little exercise in creative accounting is the disclaimer if you will that these numbers were from the cdc now the cdc did no specific studies in any one state the states used the cdc numbers which even today remain controversial to the extreme and divided them up according to population it is these kinds of unsupported nonscientific generalizations that continue to feed the antitobacco movement it is extremely well fed with your dollars and with neither your permission nor with any hope of you receiving any direct benefit from the money extracted we have little sympathy for the big cigarette industry as you must have realized while reading these pages over the years however as we will continue to explore there is a great deal of difference between processed tobacco by products such as used in packaged cigarettes and real tobacco even more to the point the burning of any natural plant substance just like real tobacco produces pretty much the same chemicals sans nicotine so for the effort highlighted below to have any credibility whatsoever the term tobacco use should be replaced by packaged cigarette use again more on that later here is the pitch for the workplace law two underlined words can and economic are worthy of note why the law is needed the law is designed to protect workers from secondhand smoke which can cause lifethreatening disease heart disease lung cancer poor respiratory health the law will reduce the economic toll smoking exacts on oregon  tobacco use cost oregonians approximately  billion in  indirect costs of lost productivity due to illness  million lost days of work  million direct medical expenditure paid for by public funds federal and state  million direct medical expenditures paid for by private individuals and businesses  million indirect costs of lost productivity due to premature deaths  million source smokingattributable morbidity mortality and economic costs sammec ii centers for disease control and prevention  so the bottom line of the above is that less than  of these so called costs to oregon were paid by oregon with an undefined portion of even that borne by the federal government the costs of lost work days and premature deaths are the worst kind of irresponsible extrapolations with absolutely no data to support the assessments further they state second hand smoke can not does cause illness and the fact that this scheme focuses completely on economic cost and not on the general welfare of humans is most telling remember i do not like smoking indoors and i dont like smoky environments i do insist however that businesses have the right to exclude nonsmokers every bit as aggressively as establishments exclude smokers  the msa and all of its ramifications present a true tragedy for american democracy and free capitalism regardless of the questionable practices of the cigarette industry this agreement has provided little to address the problem and has encouraged local state and federal governments to become more addicted to tobacco than smokers themselves most everyone in this country is unhappy with the inefficiencies and corruption associated with this settlement except of course for those who are getting rich from it congress insisted on tracking the msa tasking the gao general accounting office to do so click on the following link to venture to a pdf provided by the government accounting office gao that congress demanded be published showing how the states have been and are using their respective share of the msa funds in some cases the states have actually used the money for tobacco cigarettes again intervention programs in most cases the states records in this matter are poor indeed in fact many of the states have already borrowed on their future msa shares to the max and all future revenues are being used to simply payback these msa secured loans much like the worker who goes to the cash connection to borrow against next weeks paycheck again this linked document click here is a fairly long read but if you dont thoroughly explore this stuff you will never have the whole picture of just how large the problem is and how little control even your elected government has or wishes to exert over these kinds of coerced programs  nonprofits in total are among the biggest businesses in this country  and the best paying for those that control them other than certain trial lawyer firms that get very rich suing companies for alleged social and business related wrongdoing it is important to note here that the fees these law firms get are enormous  like the  billion dollars one firm got for helping litigate the msa settlement and another that got over a billion of course the real dog work of these nonprofits is done by volunteers both generous of heart and armed only with dogma lacking any concrete scientific information their ceos are literally in a class akin to royalty whereby unlike top tax paying industry ceos whose salaries are frequently attacked they have a federal tax code guaranteed advantage and they are tough to pin down for performance evaluations as their missions are never intended to be accomplished people just give them money or are forced to through taxation and all those donors have extremely limited control over where that money goes keep in mind that all tax free nonprofits are again required by law an expenditure of only  of their take be applied to their mission even targeted donations have an expiration date if not spent on the target more worrisome is that there is no requirement for them to succeed in their mission private sector businesses and even most politicians cant get away with that lack of performance for very long so they justify their existence by making a lot of noise about all the things they do looking only at two subjects  natural disasters and disease it is apparent that these nonprofits are abject failures however in the business of wealth generation for themselves they are amazingly proficient want more for instance      the head ceo of the oregon states goodwill for portland area chapter only pulled down over  per year until enough people found out about it and complained it is now down to around  the head of american cancer society nearly  of a million per year the numbers are staggering the red cross more than  million per year  percs which nearly doubles that for its revolving door ceos who keep getting replaced for political reasons with literally trillions of dollars in funds and endowments the nonprofit industry and ensuing scandal that is waiting to detonate regarding themwill be of unprecedented proportions and the problem has grown exponentially since the nonprofit industry got involved in the tobacco issue you can bet when that cash cow is finally dry they will find new cattle  fast food suvs sugar treats soft drinks and yes we speculate soon caffeine look out starbucks  youve got temptingly deep pockets and your lattes are fattening and doctors for a long time have urged their patients to go easy on the coffee and caffeine which has recently been classified as an addicting substance  this new wave of extortion in the name of the public good has already started and now includes new hiring and employment practices that insist on controlling the personal behavior of employees even in the sanctity of their own homes you as tobacco users have had the dubious honor of paying for a whole lot of it initially but be aware that ultimately every person in this country who has a passion for anything that a handful of people may not appreciate will be attacked the core idea of nonprofit charitable organizations is a laudable one the execution has been an alarmingly underregulated underscrutinized and in general an enormously costly failure when defined by the actual positive accomplishments they can honestly claim the only solution is an allout war on these institutions a war that will make their war on tobacco seem amicable by comparison if we lose this war this country and its citizens will eventually live under a tyranny even more destructive than those enforced at gunpoint the all pervasive tyranny of the mindless the irresponsible and the hopeless  so before we look at the bad news and worse case scenarios which are frankly fact already or likely to happen very soon unless serious intervention is undertaken by all concerned citizens we need to show you the true face of the enemies of freedom  of those parasites that drive the vehicles of corruption and of those who are their dupes and let it be made clear here that weve as much contempt for the dupes as we have for those whose corruptions nurture and coopt their weak minds and principles it is not our intent to dial into and spread the very state of fear we reject as a motivating force anger and refusal to comply and then action is not fear it is indeed the inherent human right of self interest we continue to implore our readership that the only solution lies in individual positive activism consolidated ultimately into positive group action that is the only path to regaining control of not just tobacco use but all related issues that threaten to control our most personal behavior and completely undermine the concept of personal responsibility we will begin with examples of the kind of unidirectional thinking as well as the selfserving hypocrisy that has been at the forefront of the antitobacco movement from the beginning it applies to future intrusive attempts by those few who would exercise control over the many we will follow with a few examples of the foregoing with the proposed and soon to be instituted new regulations on your rights to acquire tobacco its not a pretty story and when youre finished reading keep in mind that we a lot of folks in and out of government are not yet at the point of definitively uncovering the whole scandal we wont stop until we do but for now heres some interesting information  a look at the real face of the antagonists of this story it really comes down to this one should not judge a person based on who they are or what they are or most especially who or what they say they are people and organizations should be judged by their actions alone its as simple as that and is the only reliable measure of a human being or a group and no matter how grandiose their public statements on what they believe or the weight of their background or credentials it is what they do and have done that is pertinent in the same way organizations cannot and should not be judged by their mission statements no matter how altruistic their stated goals may be it is their actions that speak most loudly and accurately and the following couple of absolutely documented activities and discourses illuminate actions on behalf of the participants you dont have to take anyones word for their motives what they say and do is more than revealing enough and is part of the public record  as with any good story one must begin with both protagonist and antagonist here for plots sake obviously the patrons of the myoryo industry is the protagonist as a free and unitary being perhaps smokers in general but the myoryo methodology we find far more defensible than merely the act of smoking while the antagonists are numerous since life is never black and white there will be we feel a lot of common ground established potentially between this industry or any movements its existence generates its proponents and those that are seemingly against it at this moment this is personal for me in the context that i dont equate packaged cigarette smoking with tobacco usage this is a narrative of what has gone on for the last few years much of which we have written about some of which is new information even for us we will find allies among other libertarians whose enjoyment of the seasonings of life will eventually be challenged as well well start with a news article that should well begin to illuminate brightly the true intentions of some of those who claim to be most opposed to the very existence of tobacco go get your reading glasses the print is of necessity small for reasons of space please note the text weve outlined in red is felt to be most pertinent and disturbing from the grand forks herald jan   grand forks north dakota the headline north dakota legislature tobacco ban gets lit up in house bill sponsored by grand forks republican defeated by  vote by xiao zhang herald staff writer bismarck  north dakota house representatives monday voted overwhelmingly against a bill proposing to ban tobacco sales in the state the measure which would make selling or using tobacco products illegal except for using it for religious purposes misdemeanors failed by an  vote the bill would have made it a crime to sell or use tobacco in north dakota with sellers facing a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a  fine the bill labeled smoking chewing or using smokeless tobacco as a less severe crime punishable by  days in jail and a  fine the bills sole sponsor grand forks republican rep mike grosz said he was disappointed by mondays vote but it did get a fair day in the sun and generated a lot of discussion said grosz a member of the house finance and taxation committee which heard the bill last week before the bill went to a vote on the floor grosz told his fellow representatives that tobacco costs the state close to  lives every year and  million in medical and productivity costs completely unsubstantiated numbers tobacco taxes are expected to bring  million to north dakotas treasury during the states current twoyear budget period which ends in june it seems the only gainers from allowing the use of this product are the big tobacco companies and groups such as the government and organizations which tax the product or sue the companies he said grosz said he would vote against all other measures on tobacco including a tax increase because trying to reduce tobacco use through those measures is like putting a bandage on a severed leg gov john hoevens proposed twoyear budget for north dakota state government includes an increase in tobacco taxes which would increase the levy on a pack of cigarettes from  cents to  cents passed committee rep wes belter rleonard chairman of the finance and taxation committee said he decided to vote no on the floor monday because he believes prohibition would drive smoking underground his committee heard the bill last week and recommended a do pass on the bill by a  vote six of the nine committee members who voted yes on the bill changed their vote on the floor monday belter told the house that committee members were frustrated last week with the testimony from antitobacco groups that testified against the tobacco ban including the north dakota medical association american heart association american cancer society american lung association north dakota public health association and north dakota nurses association theres no evidence banning tobacco would prevent and reduce tobacco use because no such approach has been implemented the groups argued the ban also could take away certain funding for these groups for tobacco control programs the north dakota grocers association supported the bill tom woodmansee the associations president told lawmakers during the committee hearing that retailers have to spend too much time and money training employees on proper procedures for proofofage in selling tobacco products he said retailers are subject to undercover stings by local law enforcement fines and license suspension belter did point out that legislators are hooked on tobacco even though not all smoke it is time for us to think about just how hooked we are on tobacco whether we smoke or not he said  note as mentioned before we used small print and will continue to do so with all of the reference articles in this section get your reading glasses if you must there is so much here that space will not permit larger type to fit efficiently so    lets analyze what youve just read first it seems that the antitobacco groups who were highly instrumental in killing this bill believe that tobacco bans would not be effective and at least one member felt a ban would drive tobacco use underground now i ask you what is the difference in a partial ban which is precisely what higher taxes and regulation on smoking is and a total ban both would seem to have a similar effect the partial ban tax perhaps less so but still an analogous effect in other words as far as consumption these antismoking groups all well established selfappointed protectors of the health of everybody made it clear that banning tobacco may not reduce its use  at all this is a fair representation of their statements i think perhaps even understated they also bemoaned that they would lose all the revenue they live on antitobacco once again is a very big business and all of their cessation programs would suffer i ask simply if there were no tobacco to be smoked why would their cessation programs be needed at all what we have here is a clear example of the dichotomy operated under by the entire antismoking movement whose very existence and paychecks rely on tobacco taxes and other taxpayer funded government programs donations from dupes and of course lawsuits these organizations are clearly as hooked on tobacco as the members of the legislature whom the bills sponsor admonished  for being just that  grosz the sponsor of the bill also made reference to two other points that need examining first even though tobacco is claimed to kill  north dakotans per year no idea where the actual figures comes from  thats right youve heard it above the self proclaimed watchdogs seem ambivalent to the proportions of that presumed tragedy more striking yet using his figures once again even as the state brings in  million per year in tax revenues from tobacco his figures show that the state purportedly loses  million in medical and lost productivity costs thats nearly ten times more than the revenue they take in a very poor business model to anyone with a rd grade education or a  calculator even if they were to raise the taxes to the level the governor wants the shortfall would still be well over  million per year again assuming any of the figures above other than the revenue the state actually takes in have any basis in reality whatsoever the truth is that the figures the states throw out as far as cost related to smoking are pure bs and always have been you can never pin any state official down to where they get their figures they are in fact pure extrapolations or whether they include costs paid by insurance companies for covered workers or by residents personally in fact were told they do which means that in more than a majority of cases however many that may really be the states dont pay a thing for smokers who get sick nonetheless they add the cost to the total again that total being highly suspect to begin with and of course they apply all illnesses to anyone who admits they smoke regardless if smoking were a minor major or no cause at all to the distress of the patient we already went through this above but some things seem to need to be repeated in order to get the required attention the other side certainly uses this tactic in compliance with the theory of say something long enough and loud enough and it will eventually become fact the very idea that the vast majority of the costs that states claim are based on as quoted above indirect costs of lost productivity due to illness and indirect costs due to premature deaths is so offensive to the thinking human that only people with an intent to profit could embrace such mythology  this kind of sheer fiscal nonsense is being played out nationwide and frankly worldwide from local level smoking bans to the federal attempts at internet tobacco control more on this as well this nonsense includes statements by acs and others that smoking bans dont hurt businesses such as bars and private clubs in nearly every case those who actually own these establishments disagree vigorously to the point that the latest restrictive law passed in washington state that would ban all tobacco use in all venues other than conveniently indian tribe lands and casinos has already generated new proposed amended legislation that allows a business to disregard the ban if their revenue dips  or more the amendment failed its first test but continues to be pursued it is interesting to note here that while i typed the preliminary version of this suddenly on national news appeared a piece that downsized the cdcs estimate of the impact of obesity on folks from  deaths per year a strangely familiar number to  currently the estimate is now down to less than  suddenly and recently that figure is back up come on america wake up none of these numbers have any basis in reality they are at best made up nonrigorous and highly convenient extrapolations for the purpose of fund raising or lawsuits and the time has come for those that use them to be audited for source and accuracy and aggressively prosecuted for blatant fraud all one has to do is look at the cdc mortality tables we keep posted on the editorial page to realize there simply aint enough bodies to go around for support of these estimates especially for those under  of age  in fact these along with other facts that have permeated the debate on tobacco not cigarettes  again they are processed tobacco products that use some really nasty chemicals in their processing are rampant in our society on almost every subject there exist myths that have been propagated to not only enhance special interest agendas but even more so to enhance their special interest pocket books there are many writers and researchers out there dispelling these myths steve milloy wwwjunksciencecom is frequently used here as a respected example of such seekers of truth there is even a discovery channel program myth busters that deals with some of the more innocuous myths  such as what really happens when you put metal in a microwave but even more to the point is a new book by john stossel of abc news shown above left that really brings home the point that our entire society and the larger world for that matter are more susceptible to sheer superstitious myth than ever before why because it is more profitable than ever before we should all take part of the blame and shame for allowing such manipulations by special interest groups of every stripe whether it is the cdc or who world health organization  a un hitman read the book read all the books we recommend you will grow a well rounded shell of skepticism that will help protect you from the sheer enormity of bs we face every day  whether it be from media or from government and most especially from socalled health activists who could give a good damn about your health they want your money folks and control over your life in order to keep getting it  that is the bottom line as in the title of the above book and from the firesign theaters for those old enough to remember that great wacky comic ensemble classic album of the s available on cd now literally nearly everything you know is wrong and as with all the books we recommend if they are not available in paperback dont be afraid to own a hardback copy they are a little more expensive but trust me you will keep these books and reread them many times for many years to come and share them with your friends a great way to spread the word of healthy intelligent and logical skepticism  next as to the health risks of smoking do not make the mistake that smoking will have no impact on your health while we are once again not proponents of smoking we do feel people have the right to at least enjoy the practice privately assuming whatever risk they after studying all of the literature out there carefully shall deem likely and without absurd taxation that funds everything but smoking related programs we are certain the paltry existing purported scientifically rigorous research data sans epidemiology which is based entirely on widely variable and suspicious statistics has been skewed confused misunderstood or downright lied about further the fact that the government and private groups are collecting revenue based on what they consider a poisonous substance seems to have been missed as a clear violation of the trust we are expected to place in these entities weve said it many times before if tobacco is that dangerous it should be outlawed like any other toxic substance it should not be a source of profit for the very same folks who claim it to be a killer think of it this way how would the populace react if the government allowed victims with aids to have unprotected sex with others as long as they paid a tax so they could not much different is it  heres yet another link that you will find interesting in fact in this issue there are many and once again if you really want to know the depth of the scandal that is brewing you need to read everything you can this linked page concerns the dichotomy of cigarettes versus real tobacco it is yet another piece of the puzzle that allows certain elements in our society to confuse the real issue  that beingpackage cigarette regulation and litigation or tobacco regulation and litigation in fact well repeat a link to an even longer dissertation by bill drake on the same subject the two links are below  the first is much shorter than the second bookmark and read them in sections if necessary  but read them youd better know what you are smoking and youd better understand that even in rolling tobaccos cheap may not wind up being so cheap httputahindymediaorgprintphpid  httpwwwktccombdrakeviewshtmlnscv  ok youve heard it all here before but lets now look at some interesting dialogue from transcripts taken from a larry king live show on the subject of smoking these transcripts are available on the cnn site well save you some time but we urge you to read each related transcript in its entirety there is an index of topics going back a number of years at the first link below now king is an avid antismoker who smoked  packs a day for many many years hes  now and again he smoked manufactured cigarettes he had a heart attack a while back and tends to completely relate his condition to smoking the fact that he was extremely overweight larry used to be a really big guy and the epitome of the a type personality does not seem to figure in to his own assessments as to the cause of his prior malady however much we respect king for some of the things hes done he is either a dupe or corrupted his various shows on the subject pander to the antitobacco activists and often result in embarrassing moments when doctors cant agree on what it is about smoking the harms some people i clearly remember in a prior show from a couple of years ago his asking a noted cardiologist how cigarette smoke harms the heart the cardiologist replies were nearly incoherent and wound up with we dont really know followed by well it can cause a stroke king changed the subject immediately i also remember perhaps the same show him asking actor kirk douglas if he thought his stroke had anything to do with smoking douglas replied to the red faced king that he hadnt smoked for over  years prior to his stroke we choose here to use the precise words from one of his shows that should make for interesting reading enough at least to stimulate our readers to view the entire transcript the following are excerpts from conversation regarding smoking on one of his shows the full transcripts of all shows from  to current are at the following link well explore other pertinent ones next time httptranscriptscnncomtranscriptslklhtml  the first show well look at is a fairly recent one from april   the day that peter jennings announced he had lung cancer jennings a heavy smoker several packs per day  up to five early on for many years quit  years ago and the announcement of his condition obviously prompted the subject of this particular episode of lkl there are several panelists in whose statements we are interested it is not our intention to defame or denigrate any of the following people they each have their own stories triumphs and tragedies and other human baggage that we all carry their statements that follow are meant to illuminate the various factors misconceptions and mystery involving the tragic disease that is lung cancer there is little doubt in our mind that cigarette smoking especially abusive amounts carries some serious health baggage for some however does the risk rise to the level to justify the extortion of hundreds of billions of dollars from smokers who will see little of that money vested in any programs that will actually mitigate to any degree any health risks that are present and again remember cigarettes are one thing and tobacco is yet another the differences in usage behavior and dose are striking for most myo enthusiasts one other thing that happened not long after this show was the announcement by christopher reeves superman widow dana that she had lung cancer dana reeves was a lifelong nonsmoker the news media went crazy over this as chris last nine years of life as a paraplegic due to a riding accident lets ban horseback riding was a model of hope for many with paralyzing ailments they also went crazy over the fact that dana was a nonsmoker  for precisely one day within two days the fluffy blonde anchor certainly no journalist by any stretch of the imagination paula zahn made the following statement in a report saying dana reeves has been diagnosed with lung cancer followed with no pause by the statement you can find out more about the effects of smoking and lung cancer at cnncom cnn is larry kings agenda laden launch pad as well the point is zahn never again mentioned that dana was a never smoker  ever again  in any of her news reports on dana that i saw over the next few weeks this kind of reporting is shameless and its tendency to leave out pertinent facts is pervasive in every network or cable news broadcast system so dialogues like the one that follows have enough time to be pretty revealing both in what is said and what king fails to ask as follow up we do that for him in red the link to the specific show follows but we have below laid out the pertinent dialogue below and one last thing before we begin  both dana and peter died within a few weeks of undergoing chemotherapy i will always wonder how long they may have lived with no such toxic treatment httptranscriptscnncomtranscriptslklhtml  the cast includes lori the widow of morton downey jr the well known talk show host who died several years ago of lung cancer and who was an avid pro smoker rights activist up until the time he got cancer and then became an avid and paid antismoking advocate though according to lori he continued to smoke next is tammy faye messner remembered forever as the former evangelical partner of jim baker who went to prison for wrong doings regarding church funds  just think raccoon eye makeup  she is the most frequent guest on kings show a fact that completely amazes me about kings perception of who his audience is following her is alan landers the former winston man a two time survivor of lung cancer who began smoking at age  and smoked  packs per day and who has a huge lawsuit against tobacco companies pending and finally dr ronald natale md an oncologist at cedar sinai hospital in la who heads major lung cancer research projects and testifies before various fda drug approval hearings on behalf of chemo and other cancer related products hes tested for pharmaceutical companies  hes involved in a lot more than that as youll see well examine a few of each panelists statements and make comments after each of their utterings while these are excerpts they are not conveniently edited to make a point these are direct quotes though abbreviated and are provided so that you will experience what we experienced as we watched the show my personal comments in red are again the follow up questions i would have asked were i sitting next to larry or other points i feel are cogent to the discussion that were overlooked or are important to note full context is available again at the specific transcript link above and we urge you to read the entire transcript for the appropriate date one last thing before we start i hate doing this i hate calling attention to the tragedy of others lung cancer is poorly understood and is a rabid killer once you get it i have all the empathy in the world for the victims and suggest you take the possible negatives of smoking seriously even if the true correlation between tobacco and health may be exaggerated for the benefit of the greedy one last thing before we start in every larry king show ive seen on the ills of smoking he uses the dynamic duo of tony randall and jack klugman though we dont use it in its entirety here it is in the complete transcript what we note on this is the fact these odd couple characters wereare in real life quite similar as to how they lived tony was a complete health nut practically a vegetarian who exercised daily and took great pride in eliminating smoking from the sets on which he worked he even claims to have perhaps been a partial founder of the nonsmoking environmental movement in the oft used by king video clip it goes like this  king to randall king because you were the most antismoking person that i knew randall i think thats true i think im responsible for some of the antismoking laws as a matter of fact i didnt allow smoking on the set  ok fine i dont allow smoking in my audio or video studios it can gum up the electronics i dont like it anywhere indoors  thats me nonetheless the point is that tony died a couple of years ago at the age of  he died from a respiratory infection from complications after what was essentially bypass surgery now how the hell does a true health advocate in both diet exercise and smoking need a bypass procedure today the raucous jack klugman is  thats right  the heavy drinking fat eating cigar and cigarette smoking no exercise walking health risk that was klugmans character and nearly identical to his real life persona is still around and kicking the point is that these two could not have had more divergent attitudes towards health and klugman survives while randall does not logically there must be more to health and longevity than the public health people will ever admit take the food pyramid defined horrible eating habits little exercise smoking and mix it with happiness and low anxiety personality type the type that spends little time worrying about what others may do or enjoy and you may have a formula for longevity that works far better than the strident missionary evangelistic and uptight anxiety ridden prohibitionist approach george burns lived to be over  even with a steady diet of cigars and who knows what else again extrapolations and predictions are nearly useless when it come to human mortality put more directly everything the public health community knows may be wrong so now the king show transcript with again the most pertinent comments in red  first lori downey after a brief video clip showing morton poignantly and i feel honestly in his mind sharing his experience with tobacco and lung cancer remembering of course the high voltage lifestyle that morton was famous for larry turns to lori downey and says king that was the late morton downey jr who died of lung cancer six years  he died after battling it for six years he died in march of  his widow lori joins us in los angeles how did mort discover he had it lori lori downey wife of morton downey jr we thought we were treating a cold at the time he had a cough and he had a high fever we went in because we thought he had bronchial pneumonia king was he  he smoked a long time didnt he downey he smoked many years he said  years that would make him very young right but he did smoke five packs a day king and he used to defend it on television do you remember i know you werent married to him then but i think you used to watch him he defended it downey i actually was married to him wrong again larry he actually belonged to the national coalition of smokers alliance so he actually sat on the board and actually believed that smokers had the right to smoke wherever they wanted to  until he got sick she used the word actually  times in three short sentences comment five packs a day my god how can anyone smoke five pack of cigarettes a day thats  cigarettes a day or one every  minutes constantly for an assumed  hour day the assumption being he got  hours of sleep which given mortons extremely high energy output that we all found edgy yet extremely compelling is unlikely since it takes nearly  minutes at minimum to smoke most packaged cigarettes he basically was smoking constantly during his waking periods and if he smoked for  years and died in his s he started awfully young no editorial here you decide if is this a typical association with even packaged cigarettes and again not tobacco but cigarettes note  by the way downey as mentioned by lori was a proponent of the right for people to smoke anywhere indoors and even around nonsmokers  i am not as to the amount of consumption the latest text on the american cancer society website draws specific attention to the fact that the more you smoke and the longer youve smoked the more the risk a direct quote the longer you smoke and the more packs per day you smoke the greater your risk found by clicking here this flies directly in the face of what most of the greediest and most venomous antismoking groups espouse specifically that dosage doesnt matter and directly supports the logical philosophy of moderation in all things  next larry asks dr ronald natale the esteemed oncologist cancer doctor i use the word esteemed as he has in his multidecade practice helped a lot of folks with lung cancer to ease the suffering  but cures  no  the following question king dr natale why  what does smoke do  we know that it does do we know why it does natale well not completely we know that nicotine is one of the most addictive chemicals ever discovered and its the nicotine that addicts people to smoking cigarettes and cigarettes unfortunately contain a large number of carcinogens chemicals that can mutate the cells and the bronchial epitheliums and even other parts of the body so those carcinogens cause lung cancer and a variety of other cancers comment first larry uses the phrase we know that it does by reading the entire transcript and all of the medical evidence available he should have in all honestly said may do not does  even often does would have been more accurate natales response shows worthy restraint in admitting that no one really knows the complete mechanisms leading absolutely to this disease  not even close to knowing bear in mind however that i do believe that a great majority of the lung cancer patients he has seen were smokers the real question is smokers of what how long and how much how deeply they inhale and on and on he further uses the phrase can mutate cells rather than does mutate cells when speaking of the introduction of carcinogens another really overly stated classification of chemicals known to create tumors  sometimes  even sometimes often  in lab rats mice when they the mice are exposed to extraordinarily large amounts of the chemical most often by injecting it under the rodents skin there should be little doubt that some carcinogens under the right conditions and in sufficient quantity can and do cause tumors some more frequently or easily in some people than others as you will hear in a moment however even rats locked in cages filled with more smoke than even the heaviest smoker would ingest in years of smoking have failed to my knowledge to present lung cancer tumors of course you cant get a rat to smoke a packaged cigarette like a human  maybe they are smarter after all than those that do smoke premades no studies have been done with myo cigarettes real tobacco and no mention was made of the fact that everything that burns create carcinogens and a lot of substances that are commonly burned create many more than does burning tobacco  a little later king tends to ramble with his lines of questions so though this next part occurs a bit later we bump it up to here because it relates to the previous question larry asks the following king dr natale without being crass what kills you what happens from cancer that causes death natale we actually dont know larry many patients with lung cancer when they die they have healthyappearing lungs or adequate amount of lungs or their heart or other organs are still functioning pretty normally somehow the total tumor mass in the body gets to a point where the body begins to shut itself down comment jeez  this is a pretty weak response from a supposedly scientifically oriented authoritative and absolutely convinced opponent of tobacco use king is the body  is it like going to war with itself doctor natale to some extent it is king like a civil war natale just about theres no doubt that the bodys immune system does try to fight the cancer but obviously unsuccessfully in most people  we skip a bit and continue with a caller its a callin show you know caller hi i wanted to ask the doctor are there serious  or actual data about people who smoke all their lives and never get cancer king doctor natale natale well there are some lucky people who can smoke all their lives and not get cancer statistically about one in eight cigarette smokers develops cancer most of them lung cancer so this is a dangerous habit comment while natalie may have seen a preponderance of lung cancer patients who were smokers he has no way of knowing how many smokers get lung cancer other than by questionable statistics provided by epidemiologists and their ilk he only knows what he has seen and that is lung cancer patients not otherwise healthy smokers again right off the bat ill tell you i hate generics like people who smoke when dealing with such a serious subject people who smoke smoke what cigars pipes cigarettes dope tea and further smoke how smoke how much of what next the term lucky offends the hell out of my scientific side its a vegas term and has no business being introduced into a scientific discussion theres a hell of a lot more in evidence here than luck but again these kinds of discussions are never really scientific and really more about the continuance of many businesses both medical pharmaceutical plus a lot of fund raising then of course the word statistically there are lies damn lies and then statistics  mark twain another gifted storyteller this is followed by the one in eight quote which i have reason to doubt as when reading statistics from all other health and antismoking sites the general statistic found though it varies considerably states that roughly  people die of lung cancer per year natale says most of the oneineight smokers who get cancer get lung cancer okay so far many other antitobacco and public health sites state that roughly  are diagnosed with lung cancer per year now right here it is important to note that unlike other statements about smoking related deaths there may actually be a database specific to lung cancer where victims have directly stated their smoking habits to their doctors so taking these numbers as better than most of the more whimsical figures most groups use like  people per year die of smoking related diseases lets analyze there are roughly  million smokers in the us if you divide that number by  which is the onein number of smokers according to natales estimate who get lung cancer you arrive at again roughly  people who smoke today are going to get lung cancer  sometime if indeed  are diagnosed per year and  die per year using either number those  folks are going to take about  years to die and  years to develop the disease of course timing is everything and projections like these do not run parallel the point is that a hell of a lot of time is going to pass before all of the  million current smokers can die from smoking or even be diagnosed for lung cancer that gives them a hell of a lot of time to be exposed to a plethora of toxins viruses and carcinogens from other sources including genetic predisposition nonetheless these numbers are tragic however even more tragic is that possibility that many other real causes will be overlooked because of the fanatical unidirectional mindset of antitobacco driven again mostly by avarice remember our mortality statistics from last issues charts in the editorial section from the cdc which showed that of the  million people total that died in   million were over  and  million were over  well keep that chart at the bottom of this issues editorial page as we will find it continually interesting king what about secondhand smoke natale theres a weak association between prolonged inhalation of secondhand smoke and the development of lung cancer a lot of those studies i believe are somewhat controversial but you can develop lung cancer from inhalation or passive inhalation of cigarette smoke from others and finally you had to know this was coming king asks about the dreaded second hand smoke ets remember now i dislike indoor smoking personally and want to enjoy my own tobacco taste and aroma not yours even so natale admits a weak association now to be fair the fiscally predatory nuts that are running around banning smoking in bars and other adult environments use figures that include other smoking related diseases nonetheless this weak association is attributed to more diseases than one could possibly have scientifically studied it for and the term prolonged exposure is yet another undefined generic term that implies a number but offers none he uses the word can when speaking at the end of both active and passive smoking which implies far less than a certainty now the groups calling for smoking bans and reaping billions dont utter the words may or can only does or will they only correctly use the word will in any true way when they use it in conjunction with and after the term free  a two word phrase that threatens their very philosophical existence and yes you probably can get lung cancer from cigarette smoke and burning leaves and diesel trucks and barbecuing burgers  before we go on with this rather morbid display i wanted to lighten the mood a bit by sharing with you a classic comedy piece brought up to date by subject matter that illustrates the problem with not asking the right question how one asks a question is essential in research little is gained by not insisting on a complete question and a subsequent complete answer its in a two column table so read the left side first then go to the top of the right column  you have to be old enough to remember abbott and costello and too old to really understand computers to fully appreciate this for those of us who sometimes get flustered by our computers please read on if bud abbott and lou costello were alive today their infamous sketch whos on first might have turned out something like this abbots the salesperson costello the customer

a comedy writer   and as an epidemiologist as well i will gladly give credit to whoever was the creator if they contact us now rather than go through the rest of the show we will briefly provide some anecdotes about the rest of the program please do go to the link way the hell above eventually to read the entire transcript the following is interesting insight into the content of the rest of the program  alan landers the winston man started smoking at the age of nine now what the hell is up with that  not to mention  packs per day  tammy faye messner once baker of the infamous jim baker never smoked a cigarette in her life and still got lung cancer  dr natales response to this is we know that  percent to  percent of the  americans who will be diagnosed with lung cancer each year have either never smoked or smoked very little so there are other things that can cause lung cancer comment you heard it here first but he earlier said  out of  smokers get cancer which we disputed as hearsay nevertheless that means that  out of  dont which means that in fact using the kind or circular logic so common today regarding smoking and health that  of smokers dont get cancer whereas with say  of nonsmokers getting lung cancer only  dont the case could be made that overall  more nonsmokers get cancer than do smokers a little like abbot  costellos piece above  two other things that need emphasizing here both disturbing first this exchange between actress epatha merkerson who has a lung cancer awareness nonprofit organization king what epatha does your educational campaign lung cancer awareness do merkerson well we provide information for people who are suffering with lung cancer for their families who care for them people can access wwwcancercareorg for any information theres ways that they can get financial help resources where they should go to get help there are online services for them to talk to people oncology specialists and so forth comment so far so good how could we possibly distrust an organization with such a noble agenda and it probably does help people who have this disease a great deal however and it is a big however the next line is more frightening to me than that which generated the fright in epatha the underlined part is most disconcerting she goes on  and it really strengthened my resolve to do this when i saw those guys standing in front of congress from the tobacco companies with their hands raised to god saying that they  said that cancer  that cigarettes were not habitforming that nicotine did not cause cancer that scared me that scared me comment well it really scares the hell out of me that someone like merkerson who has been involved with this for years still thinks nicotine causes cancer and that cigarette companies are tobacco companies as i hope most of you know nicotine is not a carcinogen and can have many benefits to balance its addictiveness  which by the way is more than often found not to be nearly as addictive as often advertised when obtained through natural tobacco products and in reasonable doses from reasonably moderate consumption sure  packs a day of packaged brands and you will likely have a serious chemical addiction to nicotine and many other chemicals as well most myo users with moderation lose their addictions pretty quickly  now two other links that should prove entertaining as a break before we continue the first is a disclaimer page from lungcancerorg this is basically a pr firm that rallies support with materials regarding smoking and lung cancer you will see in this disclaimer that they absolve themselves of any responsibility for accuracy or to stand behind any of the so called facts they publish for the benefit of the public health lobbyists the second link is to a page that discusses the strange coincidence of actors including john wayne who died from lung cancer which was blamed entirely even back then on his smoking habits after working on a film in the deserts near nuclear not nuculear gw test sites both pages are required reading as stated before to get the whole picture httpwwwlungcancerorgmiscpagesfsmpdisclosurehtm httpwwwstraightdopecomclassicsahtml  before we continue with dr natale and drug companies we thought it prudent to show you what he said to king regarding cigars king are cigars just as bad dr natale natale cigars are bad because the nicotine content is enormous so the nicotine addiction from that high dose can be really difficult to satisfy by just continuing to smoke cigars so many cigar smokers ultimately have to turn to cigarettes comment if cigars are such an enormous source of nicotine why would anyone need cigarettes as well this is an entirely illogical bunch of twaddle most disturbing as it comes from the mouth of a touted expert on tobacco and health the truth is people smoke cigarettes for different reasons than cigars inhaling tobacco smoke from a cigarette is far different from the normal practice at least of sucking on cigars and enjoying the ambient smoke without inhaling it directly  i now want to explore dr natales association briefly with big pharmaceuticals this association is often necessary for doctors like natale to get drugs for trial that may ease the symptoms or cure people altogether of diseases other than cancer of course this kind of research partnering is needed and to be respected  as long as there is no financial advantage for the researcher personally to find the drug in question efficacious when reporting hisher findings to the fda to enhance its approval and therein lies the devilish details medicine is not an exact science in so far as new drugs and less than cooperative diseases go more dollars are needed for research but they need to be spent wisely in the case that follows in  dr natale was engaged in the study of a lung cancer drug chemotherapy for relief of the symptoms of nonsmall cell lung cancer the drug was iressa and for discussion the generic name you can easily find and then instruct me on how to pronounce it anyway the study was conducted using iressa which has far fewer side effects than heretofore other chemo drugs and natales results were very positive side effects of chemotherapy are often horrible more so than the oft reported losing of ones hair in fact nearly all lung cancer fatalities could be ostensibly blamed on the extreme toxicity of typical chemo drugs were one eager to skew the data  but who would do that they the drugs hurt they make you sick as hell but they can relieve some the worse symptoms of the disease itself and can in some cases accomplish or claim to partial or even complete remission of the malignancy a worthy endeavor to say the least the following link points to a formal hearing and testimony before the fda committee on such drugs regarding iressa a drug from the giant international pharmaceutical company astrazeneca pharmaceuticals lp who also makes the suspiciously sexy and attractive little purple and gold pill nexium you see advertised  times per day on nearly any station you choose at this link natale gives glowing testimony as to the success of the drug iressa follow the link  a new page will open which you should close when done and after you find about halfway down a pretty long page natales testimony the link is httpwwwfdagovohrmsdocketsactranscriptsthtm i hope you actually go there and spend some time reading both natales results and the testimony of other witnesses cancer survivors to the amazing qualities and successes with this drug however a subsequent trial showed absolutely no benefit to this drug whatsoever at least for late stage cancers it was successful on in natales tests this after fda approval there are however mitigating circumstances especially the fact that none of the people who testified at the first fda hearing were smokers even though they contracted lung cancer and natale is specific at times about the fact that this drug may not help smokers or more likely the kinds of cancers though oncologically similar that are purportedly characteristic of smoking related tumors iressa was dropped by astrazeneca soon after although it is only fair to point out that the company made a lot of money on it in the meantime and a lot of patients continued to feel it was helping them i often wonder how much the belief a patient has in the efficacy of any drug most especially one that has few of the horrible side effects of most chemotherapy concoctions has to do with its success rate of course i also wonder about the accuracy of the initial diagnosis of such diseases as well  and i am not the only one who remembers the scandals of the s regarding unnecessary and massive surgeries relating to breast cancer assuming youve read above the glowing recommendation of dr natale in front of the fda hearing committee regarding iressa the link is repeated here so read the damn thing httpwwwfdagovohrmsdocketsactranscriptsthtm here is the later news on iressas ultimate rejection httpwwwcancerpagecomnewsarticleaspid and what we found even more enlightening was that dr natale was and is an employee of the pharmaceutical company that produced iressa astrazeneca though his test results showed significantly positive results and the handpicked patientwitnesses who testified in front of the fda many of whom were asking for a fast track approval all looked incredibly positive natale never mentioned his direct connection to the pharmaceutical giant either at the hearings or on the king show i suppose the members of the fda panel board judges if you will knew of it as it was disclosed in the initial heading under those representing astrazeneca but i initially read this as those representing positive results of the trials not direct employees of the firm it took some digging to find all the connections but eventually we found a page that pretty much sums it all up the link to it follows and the paragraphs that follow the link are just two of several illuminating series of facts httpwwweurekalertorgpubreleasescmccpkphp who physician ronald natale md the principal investigator on the clinical trial at cedarssinai medical center acting medical director at cedarssinai comprehensive cancer center and national program director for lung cancer for salick health care inc is available for media interviews a patient who participated in the study at the cedarssinai comprehensive cancer center and testified before the fdas oncologic drug advisory committee is also willing to be interviewed the cedarssinai comprehensive cancer center is managed by a subsidiary of salick health care inc salick health care inc is an independently operated subsidiary of astrazeneca a lot of stars have gone through cedarssinai medical facility and a lot of them never left one would imagine that even the beverly hills crowd that patronize this facility might look elsewhere oh and there remains great controversy regarding the salick health care facilitys and the way astrazeneca literally kicked out its namesake founder bernard salick search the internet for salick health care and you will find this dirty little secret as well heres a good start on that issue httpwwwnurseweekcomnewszenecahtml  we will finish this issues cover with a couple more interesting things we uncovered during our research over the last year to say what youve seen so far is small in comparison to the volume of material weve collected during that time is an understatement of epic proportions the fact is there are at least  pages of material of this length in the can i can only guess that it will someday be a book certainly all the writing and documentation is done time will tell however those most juicy tidbits that weve shared in this issue would be incomplete without this last item it is a study in the sheer audacity of the nonprofitantitobaccopharmaceuticalgovernmentalpublic health coalition these groups having bled hundreds of billions of dollars from smokers with little to show for it had the added nerve to sue philip morris under the umbrella of the rico statutes for another  billion dollars the document heading below can be found by searching but it is three hundred pages of some of the most inane legal arguments i have ever seen i would not recommend its reading to even the most bored of legal scholars this case was thrown out on the grounds that rico penalties did not apply and the extravagant monetary awards were reduced to a limit of  billion however money aside it is the appellees in this case that are most disturbing the us government teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry armed with reams of testimony for nonprofit antitobacco groups and public health departments to try to get the court of appeals to allow the former  billion amount to be used as a set sum at a lower court level decision before a verdict was even reached when you find this document you will see that the opinion written by the judge throwing this out was one of surprising insight and courage even so the fact that the pharmaceutical industry was suing the very companies they do business with for their nicotine replacement products is so absurd that it is difficult to write about with a straight finger read forcesorgs norm kjonos column regarding this case the following link has both his comments and a direct link to the complete decision again it is frustratingly long but if you want a detailed look at the collusion between the aforementioned groups this really nails it the clinton administration started this but bushs attorney general alberto gonzales has taken it up with full permission from his boss for those of you who think republicans are on the side of honesty and freedom think again this travesty is supported by both parties now do you finally believe me when i tell you it is time for a new party one that respects the rights of business and individuals over incredibly powerful special interest groups sure big cigarette companies are special interest groups as well but they didnt get that way by suing people they produced a product that could be freely chosen to use it is a lousy product and should not be confused with real tobacco but the fact that these appellees were asking for even more money after the msa already was shown to have been money wasted on everything but tobacco intervention demonstrates that this coalition has gone over the edge of sanity again read norms treatise on this and if you can stand the pain the whole decision this is not over yet the parasites will never give up until they are put completely out of business heres the link httpwwwforcesorgwriterskjonofilesfedsuithtm  and finally we again urge you to read stephen baxters book evolution this piece of docufiction has fascinating insights into those parts of each of us that have not changed since the first living creature appeared on earth the give and take of survival and the absolute necessity of controlling ones own destiny as well as the fragility of the species and the durability of the planet it is perhaps the most interesting piece of scientific extrapolation ive ever read and it is a fun read as well do yourself a favor and explore with baxter what has been what might have been and what could be you wont be sorry enjoy  the ed  our greatest hope at this magazine is that we will stimulate our readers and those they come in contact with to begin a journey that involves increased self reliance and control over every aspect of their personal lives if you dont like taxes or the legislation your representatives are supporting find new candidates and vote for them if you work for someone else start your own business on the side stay flexible eat healthy exercise regularly practice moderation and by all means have fun exorcise the bitterness life sometimes injects and replace it with a sense of adventure look up once in a while and remember the dreams we had of the stars when we were kids begin to think of the larger universe where opportunities unimagined lie the only limit to the achievements possible for each and every one of us are the ones that we place on ourselves or allow other to place on us with these principles in mind let us once again state the purposes that guide the production of this publication  most of the information in this magazine is directed solely at those people of legal age who already smoke those who are trying to reduce their tobacco intake those wishing to spend less money on tobacco and who are interested in creating their own cigarettes using high quality tobacco products of their choosing  in general those who wish to have in our opinion a far more satisfying and economical smoking experience when compared with smoking premanufactured cigarettes we in no way wish to encourage people to smoke further we subscribe to a more sane more logical approach for those that chose to smoke that involves common sense as to quantity coupled with a strong commitment to manage the habit until it becomes an occasional freely chosen diversion that can be fully enjoyed without obsession and hopefully with minimal health risks no sensible person should assume that the intake of smoke or other pollutants of any kind can be advantageous to your physical health and we feel that any tobacco use implies demonstrable statistical risk of varying degrees for varying groups of people we submit that if you do not smoke it would seem illogical to start however we are likewise extremely interested in future determinations as to the degree of risk based on dosage and smoking material and encourage much more research to be undertaken using sound scientific methods that can be looked at as universally credible once again  our position on tobacco  it is our position that because of the sheer enormity of money that is involved in the tobacco debate and the fact that such vast amounts of resource can breed fraud and corruption as evidenced by the large number of claims of violations attributed to the cigarette industry as well as counterclaims of fraudulent research methods by those on the other side of the issue much more needs to be done to quantify the specific elements of tobacco smoke as well as specific elements of other sources of smoke and pollution in our environment that can lead to health problems we therefore stress as a logical and necessary step forward in order to ameliorate the controversy and lessen the divisive nature of the subject that any and all tax revenues that are collected on tobacco as well as all punitive damages collected on behalf of us citizens by all local state and federal litigations against tobacco other than those funds already allocated that are needed to satisfy current regulation and enforcement be applied to five  areas of investigation and compensation exclusively these areas are  scientifically rigorous comprehensive research on tobacco and health with full public disclosure detailing the accounting for the amount of research money distributed of how decisions are reached as to the ways and means said research money is distributed and to whom the research money is awarded and why  full disclosure and complete public dissemination of information on experimental methodology and subsequent findings that are validated by the oversight of nonpartisan scientifically qualified panels that are accountable to the taxpayers by way of unimpeded public scrutiny and debate  all revenues allocated to any of the above as well as to the subsequent health care of individuals who may be found damaged by tobacco or to education programs for tobacco intervention must be used in a costefficient manner as determined by full disclosure and reasonable consensus between these scientifically qualified panels and representatives of those who bear the burden of taxation  during the above research phase should other sources of polluting elements in our environment be found to be significant factors in the symptomatic expression of illnesses previously attributed solely to tobacco use that those found culpable be held fiscally accountable to the degree determined by the same scientifically qualified panels with suitable restitution to the tobacco taxpayers as a consequence  additionally be it found that institutions or individuals have purposely for profit or gain of status misstated or overstated the impact or role of tobacco usage in the symptomatic expression of certain illnesses those found culpable of purposeful deception for profit be held fiscally accountable to the degree determined by the same scientifically qualified panels with suitable restitution to the specific taxpayers as a consequence in conjunction with the possibility of criminal prosecution for fraud  the emerging make you own philosophy which is basically to regain control of our ability to chose and be proactive in our views especially as it extends well beyond the scope of tobacco is potentially a very powerful political force that with enough visibility could foreseeably change the way our government looks at the control of its population and better define the risks governments take in supporting taxdriven social engineering schemes we at ryo magazine are dedicated to the prospect of accurate and fair information regardless of subject as well as the uncompromising appreciation of quality above profit profit will come from quality and havemore lasting benefits as well we also believe that given complete and honest data humans are more than capable of making wise decisions with the recent increases in taxation on packaged cigarettes in so many states even greater interest is being directed at this magazine and the industry as a whole this is increasing daily we feel an obligation to play it straight with our readers who come from every point of view imaginable from every continent on the planet as they are our most valuable resource  as myo becomes more well known some will say it is just another way to encourage people to smoke while patently untrue for now the industry must be wise enough to never take that path regardless of the possible financial rewards smoking is selfindulgent private behavior and if conducted responsibly in moderation and away from those who want no part of it it may one day prove to be less of a health risk we can only go by what we hear from our readers personal acquaintances and our own personal observations that is that package cigarette smokers who convert to the myo methodology tend to smoke less appreciate the flavor of tobacco more and eventually gain control to the point that tobacco is a freely chosen occasional treat and often they eventually smoke so little that their one or two cigarettes a week are quite possibly of little consequence to their overall health certainly less so than poor diet and lack of exercise providing that kind of alternative to the lifestyle of millions who may be damaging their health smoking pack after pack of manufactured cigarettes daily we feel can only be viewed as an improvement smoking tobacco or breathing in any kind of smoke or other particulate matter must certainly pose some health risk our aim is to find the truth as to dosage and degree of risk however since we are convinced that the myo method has improved the lives of many smokers already attracting more current smokers to an environment where quitting is far easier and moderation is a fact seems a worthy enterprise  check out the links below and keep abreast of what is happening in the tobacco wars these areas directly effect you and your right to smoke as well as other endangered freedoms more and more every day keep in mind though that our position remains that nonsmokers should not be exposed to others smoke we feel that businesses that want a smoking environment should have that choice and be able to discriminate against potential employees and customers who do not smoke the reverse is in wide practice already  the ed  httpwwwtobaccoorg   a pretty comprehensive site with pertinent tobacco issues definitely skewed towards antitobacco but with some minor balanced exposure to other sides of the question we suggest you keep abreast of what is there as it is always good to both know what the potential enemies of free choice are up to as well as experience for yourself some of the absolute unsubstantiated and anecdotal twaddle that is thrust into the hands of the media and congress this site is a perfect example of why we need much more scientifically sound and current research on tobacco and health this site is interesting if for no other reason that it will keep you up to date on the draconian legislation that lies ahead that your vote might affect  httpwwwjunksciencecom  a highly entertaining site exposing fraudulent and expensive scientific extrapolations  httpthomaslocgov  current past and pending legislative actions bills and sponsors  a huge resource  httpwwwcatoorgpubspaspaeshtml  a white paper produced by the cato institute covering the shelby amendment which requires that all aspects of research whose findings lead to legislation being enacted be made part of the public record available to all fascinating reading although research organizations have been painfully slow to comply  also most of the news services cnn fox abc msnbc etc have extensive archives of smoking related articles both pro and con they are great resources for both sides of the issue their websites are easily found in search engines or by url ie cnncom below are some additional links to sites with some indepth information on the colorful and fascinating history complete with photos of the american tobacco industry  jim shaws burnt offerings lots of photos of old cigarette packs ads and other historical esoterica  the cigarette pack collectors association compendium of cigarette historical data and collectibles with lots of links  the duke family homestead fascinating history of the founder of the american tobacco companyand duke university editors note these reviews are solely for the convenience of people of legal age who already smoke are trying to cut down on smoking wish to spend less money on their smoking want to roll their own cigarettes from high quality tobacco and in general wish to have a far more satisfying and economical smoking experience when compared with smoking premanufactured cigarettes we in no way encourage people to smoke further we subscribe to a sane more logical approach to smoking that involves common sense as to quantity coupled with a strong desire to manage the habit until it becomes an occasional freely chosen diversion that can be fully enjoyed with minimal health risks finally we strongly encourage those who do smoke to take it outdoors or to appropriate environments where tobacco can be enjoyed away from those who do not smoke most especially children we do not sell tobacco or related products from this site we distribute information about our perceptions of the quality of what is available and where it can be obtained if you are under  it is illegal to buy tobacco and you should immediately exit this site if you do not smoke it would seem illogical to start    ryo magazine a publication of the andromedan design company ryo magazineis a trademark of the andromedan design
