begins october   when christopher columbus reached the beaches of san salvador in the west indies from the first meeting between europeans and americans it was obvious how important tobacco was in american culture columbus wrote in his journal how they offered his spanish sailors fruit spears and certain dried leaves for which columbus could think of no use so columbus and his crew welcomed the fruit and spears the dried leaves they threw away three days later columbus met a solitary native american in a canoe he also offered the dried leaves and made a great show of his offering no doubt the europeans wondered why the dried leaves were so highly valued the following month two sailors rodrigo de jerez and luis de torres were sent on a three day expedition across cuba they reported how the natives wrapped tobacco in a musket formed of paper and after lighting one end inhaled smoke through the other jerez and torres became the first europeans to smoke tobacco rodrigo de jerez became a confirmed tobacco smoker probably the first european to become addicted to nicotine later voyages would discover the importance of tobacco in native american cultures tobacco was used by native americans in all temperate regions of the americas in some areas where it could not be grown people made long voyages to trade skins for tobacco it was used only by males as a social drug much as it is by people today but tobacco was also used for medicinal and spiritual purposes by most native american tribes long before the europeans were rediscovering america native americans were using tobacco in all its forms cigarette snuff cigar and chewing tobaccos were all being used for hundreds of years before columbus arrival but smoking tobacco through a pipe was almost universal for native americans just about every native american culture in the americas had a pipe of some kind and it was the most common method for smoking it was from the west indian snuffing pipe called a tobago that tobacco got its name there were two species of tobacco cultivated and most preferred by native americans nicotiana rustica from north and central america is somewhat bitter and was smoked through a pipe and nicotiana tobaccum from central and south america and the west indies is mild enough to be smoked as a cigar or cigarette they would also smoke wild tobaccos called nicotiana petunoicles which are very harsh but were used in the absense of the cultivated tobacco species from the beginning europeans and native americans most preferred smoking the south american nicotiana tobaccum over all other tobaccos the spanish and portugesse were the first european countries to set up tobacco settlements in the new world the settlements were established in central and south america to grow the nicotiana tobaccum to be exported to europe the addiction would soon spread to france and england and the rest of the world the first english tobacco colony was set up at jamestown in virginia john rolfe first introduced the south american nicotiana tobaccum into north america on his plantation at jamestown in  it would be a great success nicotiana tobaccum would soon become the most favored tobacco by people all over the world it is the only tobacco cultivated and marketed in the world today john rolfe grew tobacco as a cash crop for british consumption and it was very profitable but the people at jamestown didnt grow enough food crops to feed themselves through the winter so john rolfe and the jamestown marshal thomas dale kidnapped pocahontas the daughter of the algonquin chief powhatan they demanded that powhattan pay a ransom of foods for his daughters safety powhattan paid but rolfe and dale then increased the ransom while being held captive pocahontas was forced to accept a christian baptism along with the name rebecca she was then forced to marry john rolfe even though she was already married to one of her own people in this way the ransom became an annual dowry the algonquins paid faithfully and the english continued to grow their primary cash crop tobacco this would end nine years later with the death of pocahontas her uncle chief opechancano attacked jamestown in  and killed  out of the  colonists but the britishamerican tobacco industry was growing and nothing would slow european tobacco consumption the story of pocahontas in its fictional form has been read by millions of elementary school children it is a romantic story of a beautiful native american woman who falls in love with an english settler at jamestown the true story is much sadder john rolfe used her as a pawn for his tobacco enterprise he even brought her to live in england where she could help market his exotic new product nicotiana tobaccum he was a complete success in the four centuries since millions of english people would become addicted to smoking and die from smoking related illnesses and his nicotiana tobaccum is being cultivated and smoked in every region on earth john rolfe is the model for tobacco industry success stop at nothing get them addicted and make money john rolfe may not have known about nicotine addiction heart disease and lung cancer but he was the first tobacco industry businessman to so relentlessly push its product there have been many to follow in his footsteps tobacco plantations grew in number all over the americas and they even tried to grow nicotiana tobaccum in europe but not with as much success as in the americas tobacco plantations were built in virginia maryland and the carolinas the labor to run the plantations could not be native for they refused to work for most settlements so a system of indentured servatude was created under this system a man could earn his passage to the americas by working on a plantation for a number of years usually seven but indentured servants were only temporary and were soon replaced by african slaves as the chief form of labor on american tobacco plantations for hundreds of years most people used tobacco in cigar pipe chew and snuff forms cigarettes were a little more difficult for to smoke them you had to keep a pouch and roll your own in the s tobacco businessman bill taylor began using immagrants in his factories as rollers he began to market ready to smoke boxes of tobacco cigarettes in  james albert bonsack invented the first economically practical cigarette rolling machine his machine produced  rolled cigarettes a day equivalent to the output of  expert rollers working  hours this was the beginning of the tobacco industry we know today the invention of the rolling machine made tobacco much more accessable to the masses and made smoking an easier habit to manage this new technology allowed james buchanan duke to create a cigarette monopoly equal to rockefellers in petroleum and carnegies in steel duke tied bonsack to a series of unbreakable contracts guaranteeing that bonsack could sell his machines to competitors but the royalties duke paid would always be  percent less james duke began mass producing and marketing cigarettes he expanded advertising and made cigarettes affordable and readily available to american consumers through price cutting he managed to subdue all his competitors and duke controlled a tobacco trust in the united states the trust soon turned on tobacco farmers and forced them to sell tobacco for three cents per pound two thirds less than they were getting before dukes monopoly but the tobacco growers formed farmer associations and fought back in  the us supreme court ruled the existance of dukes monopoly in violation of the sherman antitrust act the supreme court forced the duke family to break up the monopoly from this antitrust break up emerged r j reynolds lorillard ligget and myers and the american tobacco company these companies along with philip morris inc comprise  percent of the american tobacco market today the cigarette fits our fast paced life style they are a fast convenient nicotine fix by  cigarettes had become the leading form of tobacco consumption in the world cigarettes fit our life style and therefore we can more easily manage this habit getting the nicotine we crave when we crave it but in the s a time when tobacco consumption had peaked at nearly  percent of the adult population smoking it was proven that tobacco causes lung cancer this discouraged many people from smoking but the tobacco industry responded with filtered cigarettes and people continue to smoke the modern american tobacco industryscience has proved beyond all reasonable doubt that cigarettes cause addiction disease and death nicotine is more addictive than herion and causes the deaths of  americans each year the use of tobacco once commonplace in american culture is now disliked by most americans nonsmokers are now aware of the harms caused by passive smoking and many restrictions on where people can smoke have been implimented even regular smokers most often wish they could stop smoking if not for nicotine addiction tobacco wouldnt be a profitable business young people would still experience smoking for a short time but when the experiment was over most would quit this expensive deadly habit tobacco is no longer a socially accepted form of behavior in american society we tolerate tobacco use because it has been with us for a long time but we would not wish for our children and loved ones to become regular smokers it seems the only people who approve of and encourage smoking are those involved with the tobacco industry for cigarette companies to maintain their sales they must recruit  million new smokers each year but there is little incentive for mature adults to begin smoking so cigarette advertising is aimed to recruit teenagers the romance and adventure of marlboro country is the appearance teens want to show they see joe camal as a cool character who lives on the edge most teens begin smoking because adults smoke or their friends smoke everyday  thousand children become regular smokers and  thousand of these children will die of smoking related illnesses in recent years the tobacco industry has been under increased scrutiny and attacks many tobacco users have filed civil suits against manufacturers for tobaccorelated illnesses to themselves and family members in july of  connecticut filed a  billion dollar lawsuit against the nations tobacco industry state attorney general richard blumenthal claims tobaccorelated illnesses cause  deaths every year in the state and a financial burden of  million dollars to treat these illnesses each year connecticut is one of ten states seeking damages against the tobacco industry the other states are florida louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota mississippi texas washington and west virginia many other states are expected to file similar civil suits in the future in  congress ordered all cigarette manufacturers to put health warnings from the us surgeon general on all packages of cigarettes sold the united states at first the industry tried to fight congress but they finally agreed and even helped write the consumer warnings as a result the tobacco industry has never lost a product liability civil suit they point out to the courts and consumers you were warned of the dangers the tobacco industry is under a constant siege of attacks by politicians the fda the media scientists and society at large but tobacco is a  billion dollar a year business with a long history of political power the tobacco industry is not going to stop this business of death voluntarily the use of tobacco can only be reduced through government intervention banning tobacco advertisements and raising taxes on tobacco products have proven to be very effective economic reducers of tobacco consumption education programs to inform the public about the dangers of smoking have also proven extremely effective the state of california had one such program called proposition  it called for an additional  cent tax on cigarettes and the money was used to fund antismoking tv ads which informed the public on the dangers of smoking as a result of proposition  cigarette smoking was denormalized in california where smoking was reduced by  percent the tobacco industry responded to proposition  with a huge lobby in the state legislature the lobby gave governor wilson then speaker of the house larry brown and members of the state legislature millions of dollars in campaign contributions wilson is still governor and larry brown is now the mayor of san francisco in return the tobacco industry got rid to the public education component of proposition  and use of tobacco in california is again rising but proposition  proved that society can reduce its number of smokers through tax and education programs like proposition  will be fought by the tobacco industry on every front but we must pressure our law makers to put the health of americans first and the interests of the tobacco industry last smoking related illnesses lung cancerlung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lung cancer develops when normal cells become abnormal and grow out of control people often wonder what causes lung cancer scientific research says that smoking is the major cause of lung cancer a small amount of patients who have the disease have never smoked that is because you can also get lung cancer if your exposed to asbestos for a long period of time also miners who work with radio active machines have also been at risk to get the disease on an average men and women between the ages of fifty and seventy who have smoked most of their lives are usually the ones to get lung cancer it is also the number  cause of cancer deaths there are  new cases of lung cancer in  there have already been an estimated  deaths this year more than  americans die of lung cancer each year world wide  million people die of lung cancer each year since  more women have died each year from lung cancer than any other cancer including breast cancer emphesyma and bronchitislung tissue is very flexible and delicate it is important for oxygen to pass through the bloodstream when emphysema occurs the lung loses its elasticity like a rubber band that wont snap back the two diseases emphysema and chronic bronchitis have been lumped together under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary disease people who begin suffering from many of the chest problems that occur from these diseases wonder which of the two diseases they have the fact is that the chances are good that they may have both to some degree most people start smoking in their early teens after a few years they may notice that their breathing is becoming slower and weaker they may also notice they get a lot more colds than people who dont smoke the reason is that the cold goes right into the chest and lingers there then they are left with a bad cough that wont go away some call it a smokers cough others may say a cigarette cough a person suffering from emphesema andor chronic bronchitis begins to feel tired more often climbing up stairs seems to feel like a big task any type of fast movement such as cooking cleaning walking etc causes breathlessness and usually follows with severe chest pains when these diseases progress severe infections such as pneumonia occur at this time they become confused and have bad headaches this is when therapy or even hospitalization is necessary some people take well to the treatments which means they have a chance if they stop smoking smoking and heart diseasecigarette smoking is the number one cause associated with heart attacks in the united states the connection between cigarettes and heart disease also cancer is so great that the surgeon general of the united states instructed that there has to be a warning against the dangers of smoking printed on every package of cigarettes cigarette smoking speeds the development of heart disease and lessens the capacity of blood flow this is what triggers a heart attack many studies have shown that smoking cigarettes is very dangerous for people that have already had a heart attack or if they are prone to cigarettes cause more heart disease and lung cancer than other forms of tobacco because cigarettes are inhaled much more often it is very important for someone who has inherited a tendancy to have high blood pressure to control their risks by changing habits and making lifestyle adjustments smoking cigarettes is a major cause of heart attacks and heart disease deaths if a person wants to lessen their chances of having a heart attack or getting heart disease the answer is to never start smoking time line of historical events  columbus reaches the west indies finds native americans smoking
