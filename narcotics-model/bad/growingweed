Growing cannabis indoors is one of the choices the grower has and one that can mean growing year round cannabis crops. This is one of the advantages, but there are some choices that will need to be made to grow inside.

The decisions that the indoor cannabis grower will need to make include what room they will use that is going to be dedicated to just the cannabis plants. This will be a room that will need the walls painted, the carpet possibly taken up and other things done, before a cannabis crop can be planted.

Then there will need to be special lighting, there will need to be access to heat and ventilation. This will also need to be a room that is not in the main traffic of the house where the windows can be blocked off. The setup for the cannabis plants is important, so they grow properly.
