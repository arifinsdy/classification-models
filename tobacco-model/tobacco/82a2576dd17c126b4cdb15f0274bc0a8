previously while lively arguments about the merits of certain pipe tobaccos can be entertaining to all this is not the place for them from jon tillman  it was ten years ago that tobacco reviews first came to be originally it was meant as a personal project to allow me as a novice pipe smoker to keep track of the pipe tobaccos i had smoked and what i thought of them it soon began to grow beyond that initial use into something that could allow multiple people to compare their reactions to pipe tobaccos from those humble beginnings through the explosive influx of users from the altsmokerspipes newsgroup to the steady growth it has seen from then on tobacco reviews has always been my labor of love with the support of all of those who donated over the years i have been able to just about cover the costs of maintaining the site and purchasing more and more bandwidth and processing power as the traffic on the site has grown in the intervening decade as the site has grown my life has seen changes as well and now i am back in school pursuing a new career in medicine as a result i find myself stretched thin between school fulltime employment and projects like tobacco reviews i find that there are not enough hours in the day to do justice to all of the tasks in front of me fortunately dayton matlick chuck stanion and the rest of the fine folks at pipes and tobaccos magazine have ridden to my rescue they will be taking over the ownership and management of tobacco reviews from now on i couldnt have asked for a better answer to my timecrunch dilemma tobacco reviews will continue to receive the attention and care it deserves benefit greatly from the close attention of a team of experts in the hobby and i will have enough time freed up to pursue my studies to all of you who have submitted reviews tobaccos corrections and pictures over the years thank you tobacco reviews would not be what it is without your generous sharing of your knowledge and time i hope that you will continue to do so for many more years and keep tobacco reviews the ultimate resource for opinion and information on pipe tobaccos around the world to all of you who have donated financially to help keep the site running thank you from me personally while i have never made any income off of the site i appreciate that your help has kept it from being a money loser for me as it got bigger and bigger you kept it going through times when i frankly would not have been able to afford to keep it online on my own all of those who have signed up for subscription donations will find that those subscriptions have been cancelled if you wish to continue to support tobacco reviews financially subscribe to pipes and tobaccos magazine join foundations or watch this space for whatever goodies chuck and company have in store for you in the future jon tillman from pipes and tobaccos magazine  youre probably wondering what this change in ownership will mean for you the tobaccoreviewscom user most important we have no plans to ever make this a pay site theres a remote possibility that  years hence when the antismoking scourge has dissipated and  percent of the population smokes pipes and enthusiastically anticipates investing in pipe information this business plan could changebut for the foreseeable future tobaccoreviewscom will remain free until were overwhelmingly swamped with urgent requests begging us to accept as much money as our consciences allow that wont change we wont be making many changes at all jon tillman has developed a wonderful venue for sharing tobacco information and we dont want to injure it through excessive meddling however there will be a few noticeable differences pipes and tobaccos is after all a forprofit entity thats a mainly theoretical distinctionweve never actually made more than could be technically defined as an embarrassingly small token profit and some years not even that still our owner dayton matlick has clearly outlined his expectations try not to lose money he says i dont want to spend my retirement years in an appliance carton so though i have no personal objection to seeing dayton live in a fridgedaire box and have investigated the same possibility for my own golden years im thinking extrawide with reinforced cardboard and a twoflap skylight we need to try to make this site selfsufficient enough to cover costs to that end you may see some banner ads appear when we find sponsors we hope youll support any companies that advertise herewe need them to keep the site operating and to finance future improvements and additions we also hope to use tobaccoreviewscom to help promote our own products well soon be adding links where appropriate to the pt trial by fire tobacco reviews including the complete database of william serad reviews as well as all of those subsequent to his tenure we may provide links to our retail print advertisers as well those options wont alter the tobaccoreviewscom experiencejust dont click on the links if you choose not to we send out an email to our list about every month or so usually promoting some product in the pt store and sometimes including news items more timely than the magazine can accommodate well soon be sending that email to tobaccoreviewscom users as well we think youll enjoy receiving it but if not opting out is a simple click so if youre wondering why weve purchased tobaccoreviewscom and whats in it for us thats the sum of our motivations but our primary purpose is goodwill we like to do things that are good for the hobby and maintaining this site definitely falls into that category we all owe jon tillman profound thanks for what he has done here pt magazine hopes to continue his good work and become a reliable steward of his accomplishment
