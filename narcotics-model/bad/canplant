Effects of Cold Temperatures on the Outdoor Cannabis Plant

The effects of cold temperatures on the outdoor cannabis plant can be disastrous for the crop and the growers expected harvest. Temperatures that are in the 40’s and 50’s can be dangerous for the cannabis seedlings in their new environment.

While it is possible to cover them with plastic bags to help save them it is better to know for certain the last frost is over and the seedlings will be safe. The seedling that is put out when the air and ground are too cool can be stunted, which means a much smaller harvest that is not as potent as it should be.
	Effects of Cold Temperatures
There is also the risk that the leaves of the cannabis plant will become opaque and then wilt and die, the stem can become weak from the cool temperatures, too weak to hold the plant up. Once this type of thing happens due to cold weather the cannabis plant will die.
