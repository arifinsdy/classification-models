    nk, of all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is the strangest. It is the most recent major drug to come to life in the psychedelic subculture. (Blah blah blah... let's get to the good stuff: How to make it in your kitchen!!)
    1) Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
    2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
    3) Filter the solution through a tight screen.
    4) Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
    5) For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
    6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1."
    7) Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days.
    8) Filter and throw away the mush.
    9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1."
    10) Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
    11) When all of the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.
    30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
    15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

    Many companies, such as Northop-King have been coating their seeds with a toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is much safer and cheaper. Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly from:

    Chong's Nursery and Flowers
    P.O. Box 2154
    Honolulu, Hawaii

    LSD DOSAGES
    -----------

    The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid is available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically, the potency of LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or mics. If you're chemically minded or making your own acid, then computing the number of micrograms is very important. Usually between 500 and 800 mics is plenty for an 8 hour trip, depending on the quality of the acid, of course. I have heard of people taking as much as 1,500-2,000 mics. This is not only extremely dangerous, it is extremely wasteful.

    LSD comes packaged in many different forms. The most common are listed below:
    1) The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop of LSD on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals one trip.
    2) Capsuled acid is very tricky, as the cap can be almost any color, size, or potency. Always ask what the acid is cut with, as a lot of acid is cut with either speed or strychnine. Also note dosage.
    3) Small white or colored tablets have been known to contain acid, but, as with capsuled acid, it's impossible to tell potency, without asking.

    Morning glory isn't LSD. It's nothing compared to LSD. MG and HBR contain LSA..related, but pale in comparison to LSD. Also, other contents in the seeds can cause major cramping and discomfort.

    No matter what dose you take, you'll trip for at least 12 hours if you have real LSD. Don't plan on going to sleep until the 12 hours is up. It won't typically work.

    A threshhold does would probably be about 75ug. I know I've had a hit of weak blotter and noticed visuals/etc. It was probably around 50-100ug (wasn't certain). A typical dose is about 200ug (mics). This is an intense LSD trip. Good visuals, awesome mindtrip, audio hallucinations, etc. 600-700ug, LSD becomes a different drug. The plateu is on a different level. This is when it starts to get weird. At around 1,000ug, you won't trip any harder...but you will trip longer with more.

    Strychnine in LSD is bullshit. http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_myth2.shtml

    Speed in capsules? I dunno...never heard of anything like that. Seems silly to add a more expensive chemical to LSD. Not only would you lose money unless you overcharged...you would probably lose customers because speed sucks. If you are getting cut acid, you need to find another supplier. Acid doesn't need/should be cut with anything. However, you may think it has speed in it...because it is an almost energizing high and sometimes there will be jaw clenching/tension involved.

    LSD is a very very very powerful drug. It should not be taken lightly. It has the potential to turn your world upsidedown. Be VERY careful with this substance. DO NOT abuse it.

    People with family history of mental disorders such as bi-polar, schizophrenia, etc should NOT take LSD as it could surface these disorders in yourself.

    DO NOT try to make your own LSD unless you're an extraordinary chemist with thousands of dollars in equipment. You can hurt yourself or others. X_X

    Read about it before you take it.

    It's actually a good way to extract the alkaloids in the seeds....however, it is by no means LSD.

    umm that looked like a legit extraction process to me.
    ive taken a bunch of morning glory trips...LSA is great, but chewing through 100s of morning glory seeds is one of the most horrible things. So extraction is probably the best way to go as far as consumption.."which i would never dream of suggesting"
    LSD comes on lil thingys called windowpanes, too. ive actually seen them...little transparent peices of colored somethin with 1 trip on em. OoOo ive seen them documented on web sites so i know im not crazy. has anyone else seen these?

    You dumbass. I try to avoid namecalling but you're going to kill someone. Morning glory and Hawaiin baby woodrose seeds contain different amounts of LSA. HB Woodrose seeds contain more then 10 times as much LSA then the same amount of morning glory seeds.

    thats not a false way of extracting lsa. ive tried it before and it works good. i dont like lsa that much because my stomach has always hurt whenever ive done them. the most ive ever done was 7 seeds and it was starting to get kinda trippy. i remember feeling like there were atleast 10 different thoughts in my head every second. like my mind was thinking for itself. but i was dizzy and lightheaded a lot.

    To all who think this is bullshit:

    This is not bullshit. If you think it is, you're ignorant to this extraction process. This chemicals used are extremely volatile, so they will evaporate completely given enough time. Two days is enough time.

    Don't knock someone for you're own ignorance.

    Nice Process 16_times, I've used a similar process before on MG seeds. The resulting product is not LSD, but the similar LSA. Good Post.

    That was probably just an error. Either way, the process described is not dangerous. Anybody with a little knowledge on the subject would know that.

    SmokeyPotter - He recommended the same amount of MG seeds as he did HBW seeds.... ((see step 1)) I'm sorry. But if I see an error in a method of extraction involving those kind of volotile chemicals.. sorry, but I just cant trust the author, and I'd think it best that others didn't as well. Also, he posted about bananadine earlier. The guy is a moron. Bananadine was a known myth 10 years ago and still is.
    But please, smokey, if you'd like, go ahead and use 150 grams of HB-Woodrose seeds. Seriously.
    Soooo uhhh, Nice post!
    And don't knock people until you're dead after trying this product. 

    lolol

    I've tripped off MG seeds with a similar method. I'm not dead...

    Come to think of it, I might as well post the method:

    Equipment:


    Coffee Grinder or equivalent to powder seeds
    2 Jars with Lids
    1 Coffee Filter or Funnel
    Coffee Filters or Filter Paper

    Chemical/Biological:

    Morning Glory Seeds (1 seed = ~ 1ug) (50-500ug=1 dose)
    Petroleum Ether
    Ethanol-based liquid suitable for human consumption in approximate order of preference:
    Reagent Grade Ethanol
    EverClear or similiar substance
    100 Proof or better vodka or gin
    151 Proof rum
    other beverages 80 proof or better
    - or -
    Water-based beverages (not preferred (nausea))


    Processing Methodology:

    If using treated seeds wash thoroughly in detergent and cold water first.
    Grind seeds to powder in coffee grinder
    Place powder in jar with a "healthy" qty of petroleum ether.
    (~360-500 ml/500 seeds (can't use too much, can use too little))
    Put lid on jar and shake it vigorously for a while. Let stand 20 minutes (you can shake it more if you like)
    Shake jar, remove lid, and pour suspension into filter (with filter paper in place). Use second jar to catch the petroleum ether than comes through the filter paper. (Windows should be open or do this outside otherwise you will get prematurely in a non-canonical fashion). If some seed powder clings to the side of the jar, rinse it out with some of the filtered ether. When finished, you will have slightly discolored petroleum ether in a jar and the powder on the filter paper.
    *** DO NOT DRINK THE PETROLEUM ETHER ***. Put the lid on that jar and save it to reuse next time (you can get at least five processing cycles out of it). Dry the seed powder THOROUGHLY. Wash and dry the empty jar.
    When powder is thoroughly dry, place it back in the jar and add alcohol. The amount of alcohol is critical, since you will be drinking it later, and will vary according to your propensities, tolerances, and the intended intensity of your proposed voyage. For light, recreational use, assuming reasonable alcohol tolerance use 1 oz. of alcohol per 30-50 seeds. For intense meditation use 1 /250 seeds. If you use a high seed/alcohol ratio you will want to prepare a large number of seeds at a time otherwise you will be working with micro-quantities and it gets more tedious (unless you like that sort of thing).
    Soak the seed powder in the alcohol, shaking frequently, for three days.
    Filter again, as before. Discard the seed powder (unless you wish to make 'soap'). Keep the alcohol for use.
    Drink the alcohol to achieve desired effect. 

    "Through the acceptance of a personal goal of individual betterment and progression, as opposed to a forced shared goal of societal stability, the function of a content individual in society becomes advantageous to that society's sustainability."

    Listen, If you took the same number of HB Woodrose seeds as you do MG seeds, I guarentee you would be dead. I've tripped off HBW seeds too so I assure you Im not ignorant to extraction methods. I've extracted Kava and Salvia AND LSA.

    150 grams of MG Seeds is an accurate dose
    150 grams of HBW Seeds is as potent as 1500 grams of MG seeds. There is a SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER AMOUNT OF LSA IN HBW SEEDS THEN IN MG SEEDS. Do NOT tell people to eat similar quantities of both like this person is.

    I believe you've tripped off MG seeds and are alive. BUT TRY TAKING 3000 OF THEM!!! That's what taking 300 ((150 grams)) of HB Woodrose seeds is like. I assure you, 3000 MG seeds and you are dead-as-fuck. Just as 300 HB Woodrose seeds and you are dead-as-fuck. 

    lolol

    READ THAT. NOTE IT SAYS USE 4-8 SEEDS!!!

    Alright. Im satisfied. This got me awful worked up, because you're encouraging people to suicide without even knowing it.

    But, if you find 4-8 seeds of HB woodrose that weigh 150 grams total.. WOW. So yeah.
