    LSD RDWC SCROG GROW

        This is my second attempt at growing. The first time things went horribly wrong. (there is a link in my signature if you are interested in learning from my mistakes)
        For this go-round I will be running a 5 site Recirculating Deep Water Culture system. In a 3'x3'x7' cabinet, with a 400 watt MH (veg) and a 400 watt HPS (flower). I also purchased some Barneys Farm LSD from the Attitude seed bank. I highly recommend Attitude so far.

        Nutrients I will be using:
            Cutting Edge Solutions 3-part
            CalMag+
            Pro-Silicate
            Hygrozime
            Liquid Karma
            Superthrive
            Bud Candy
            Big Bud
            Overdrive

        There appears to be a problem with uploading pics at the moment, but as soon as it is resolved I will upload the pics so far.

        So i found a "backdoor" way of postings pics for now. What I did was uploaded pics to my album. I then copied the "BB code" for each picture, (this is found under the photo when viewed in your album) and copied it into my post. There you have it, a solution to pics for now. I do hope they get this problem fixed soon.

    Germination

        I decided to start the seeds in Rapid Rooter plugs this time. My local shop had a big bag of individual ones for sale. Although they were all dried out.
        To prep the Rapid Rooter plugs I soaked them in a solution of; RO water, 5ml/gal CalMag+, 5ml/gal Hygrozime, and 1ml/gal of SuperThrive with an adjusted ph of 5.7.
        I soaked the seeds in a glass of spring water for about six hours. They did not sink, but I thought that this would help them get a head start. I then squeezed out most of the water from the plugs, so that they were just moist. Placed the seeds in the provided holes, and tore a piece of the plug off from the bottom to cover up the holes. They were then placed directly under two 23watt cfl bulbs. I don't have a humidity dome, so they dried out within a day. I watered each with 10ml of the same solution as above. I did this at the same time every day. The beans went into the Rapid Rooters on 09/19 and on 09/21 three had already popped up. The next day so did the fourth, and on the fourth day all were up and growing. Today I removed the cfl's and turned on my 400watt MH. The light is about four feet above them, and over the next few days I will slowly lower the light.
        This grow is going way smoother than my previous one.
        Last time I went through six seeds, and only had two survive.
        For the last few days I have also been prepping out my Hydroton. It has been soaking in a five gallon bucket, and I correct the ph each day. Today the ph stabilized at 5.9.

    Seedlings 10 days old

        For the past week there has been a huge heatwave here. My cab temps have been at 90*F. I believe this has caused growth to be slow so far. They are resting in their new homes now, and are on a 18/6 light schedule. Also starting feeding with a mild solution.

        The Soup:
            RO Water
            5ml/gal CalMag+
            10ml/gal Hygrozime
            1ml/gal SuperThrive
            1.25ml/gal each of Micro, Grow, and Bloom

    Seedlings 17 days old

        Room Temp = 82*F
        Res Temp = 74*F
        Humidity = 40%
        PH = 5.5
        PPM = 1000 @ 0.5 (600 before res change last night)

        Yesterday I noticed that they were getting some type of deficiency. So I did a res change and upped the nutrients. Originally I was thinking that it was a calcium deficiency, but now I'm not sure because they are turning grey. Root growth seems to be stunted also. Any advise on what's going on will be greatly appreciated.

        The Soup:
            RO water
            10ml/gal CalMag+
            10ml/gal Hygrozyme
            5ml/gal Pro-Silicate
            4ml/gal each of Micro, Grow, & Bloom

        This one has grown with this coloring sine day one. I have no idea what it could be. Has anyone ran into this before?

    24 Days Old

            Room Temp = 80*F
            Res Temp = 68*f
            Humidity = 40%
            PH = 5.6
            PPM = 1000 @ 0.5

        I think I transplanted to soon, because they are not really rooted yet. The way my container is set up, I can not submerse the net pots. So I have been top watering a couple times a day. I also found out that there has been some sort of growth in the res. It doesn't seem to be an algae or fungus growth. I believe it may be some sort of water born pathogen. It's white and has the consistency of a rubbery jelly. It clogged my return line and took over the bottom of the net pots.

        So today I made a smaller tub that for now they will call home, while I'm breaking down and cleaning the other system. They will stay in this tub until they are fully rooted, because the net pots can be submersed now. All of them had to be removed from their pots cleaned and re-potted with new hydroton. I also started using some H2O2 and tap water in the res. The idea behind the tap water is maybe it will help kill this stuff off.

        If anyone has some ideas or knows what this jelly stuff is, please let me know.

        The Soup:
            10ml/gal 30% H2O2
            5ml/gal CalMag+
            5ml/gal Pro-Silicate

        The temp of your res. should be about 58 degrees. That will help with algae and other water borne ailments.

        I forgot to mention that it is the temp of the water that helps with oxygen absorbtion by the roots. Healthier roots make healthier plants.

        Ga, thanks for the advice.
        Since they've been in the new tub, I have been trying to keep the water temps lower. It fluctuates between about 55*F to 72*F right now, due to the fact I can't afford a water chiller. I use frozen water bottles to try to control water temps. The only problem is I gotta sleep sometime. So this is when the temp slowly rises over night.

        Add 2 liter bottles then you'll lengthen the time frame.. Wish you the best!

    Still fighting the MONSTER JELLY

        Last night I noticed that the white rubbery jelly substance was starting to come back. The H2O2 apparently just was no match for this monster. I was afraid to go any higher with the doses. Was already pushing it with 10ml/gal 30%. This stuff also seems to love oxygen.

        So did a res change today. Washed off all of the stuff I could find, and of coarse sanitized everything. Now I'm going to see how the Hygrozyme reacts with it.

        New Soup:
            Tap Water
            5ml/gal Hygrozyme
            5ml/gal pro-Silicate
            5ml/gal CalMag+
            5ml/gal each of Micro, Bloom, & Grow

        Has anyone dealt with, or heard of a guy with this type of growth in the reservoir before? Any and all comments are more than welcomed on this subject.

        What type of water are you using? I found that when I was using my well water in my HYDRO set up my PH would swing more as well as the water would get kind of milky? I would appear to have a fog in the water after about 2 days after my res changes. Now with distilled no issues at all

        I started with RO water, but since the growth I'm now using tap water. Was hoping the stuff in the tap would help fight it off.
        My ph has been pretty steady, and water stays clear.

        Thanks camo

        Well the jelly is still persisting. My next idea is to try some beneficial bacteria.

        Today I went to my local hydro shop and talked with the guy for a bit. He is also stumped and not heard of this type of growth before. He then pulled out a freebie from a trade show, and gave it to me to try.
        It is called Cobra. So yet again the soup is changing today once lights go on.

        The Soup:
            Tap Water
            5 ml/gal Hygrozyme
            5 ml/gal CalMag+
            5 ml/gal Pro-Silicate
            5 ml/gal each of Micro, Bloom, & Grow
            1/2 tsp/gal Cobra (beneficial bacteria)

        tiki,
        Lemme ask ya,this.. Has any of the equipment that you use,ever been used with a salt water aquarim? Like a reef tank. If you said yes. It would be a Brown like jelly that attacks coral. I was just curious..

        Ga..

        No salt water, just from the Home Depot.
