Anza Blog English Translation Anza Blog English Translation Anza Oyama, lead singer for Head Phones President, English Blog translations from the official websites. www.myspace.com/anza_hpp, www.anza.jp, and http://headphonespresident.blogspot.com Thursday, June 11, 2009 *On Hiatus* I have an official announcement to make regarding the Anza Translation Blog. As of now, I'm going to have to put translating Anza Blog's into English on hold. My apology's to everyone who was coming here to keep up with Anza news. I can easily translate her blogs for myself now and keep up with her, but to write it all out properly to post on the Blog is very time consuming and I can't keep up with her and all her blogs. I hurt my knee earlier this year and it's been taking forever to feel better. Between fighting that and numerous computer problems that pop up from time to time, I'm going to have to put this on Hiatus. I think another big reason that this is the proper thing to do right now is that it's been a year and a half since HPP's last show in America. And it doesn't look like they'll be doing a show here in the forsee-able future. So, translating her Blog right now doesn't make much sense. So, until there's an official announcement of an HPP show in America, I'll have to put this on hold.

Here's the Blog photos.* Posted by Matt at 6:02 AM 2 comments Links to this post Anza JP Blog 6/1/09 Dangerous!! I've returned home right after the live shows in Sendai City and Sapporo City ended safely~. However, my body is feeling tired even though I'm so very HAPPY. (heart) To start with, Thank you to everyone who came out to the concerts!! I really felt the hot feeling everyone was transmitting from their heart. It made me feel warm inside....HPP will certainly return and play there again!!! Please be looking forward to it, OK?! And now.....there were too many delicious foods to eat!!! (laugh) The local dish in Sendai City that you certainly had to try was the Ox tongue and Mochi rice cakes!! In Sapporo City, the thing you had to try was the sushi and fresh seafood bowl. Also, the sweets and shaved ice..... I overate!!!!(laugh) But, as clever as I am at finding good food, I had to avoid eating more~!!!! Tomorrow, I'll have to take it easy for a while and let my stomach shrink back to normal. (laugh) I need to get back to writing song lyrics. Now, June has started. This month I'm rushing into a fierce schedule!!! I'll be making several different announcements this month, so keep checking in, OK?! I think that's everything~!!!!!

It's too late but I translate 2009/05/24 entry for Anza.jp blog. Here. ********** We've got the end of our hard schedule and now I have a lot of tired. First... I was so happy to be in IN THIS MOMENT's tour as guest for two years and it ends without troubles. ITM members are wonderful, their live performances were full of powers. This time we had some interviewes and went to Harajuku for shopping, so I was pleasure to spend all the time and talking a lot with them for 5 days. Then after that, we worked for mixed down of HPP for 3 days without holiday. We the members are making serious to the musics. I know it's so good music!! And we have tours in Sendai and Sapporo in this week! Also check the informations on HPP-official about radio appearance! Ah! I heard that HPP's article on news like Natalie! Please check it!!! http://natalie.mu/news/show/id/16806 The thunder seems occuring... I'm afraid a little.(laughing) ********** I wish it will be an help for you. ---Akira. Posted by Matt at 3:42 AM 1 comments Links to this post Tuesday, June 2, 2009 Anza Myspace Blog 6/1/09 I've returned home! current mood: voluminous The live concerts in Sendai City and Sapporo City have ended safely. It's been about a year and a half for this meeting to again take place. Still, in spite of this, I think both places are charming!! The live shows were hot and I got power from everyone's cheering. It made me really happy down deep in my heart!! Thank you, truly. (heart) Anyway, the HPP members had a lot of meals to eat. (laugh) Hey! It's inevitable when there are so many delicious foods to try!!! I'm already missing the Ox tongue, the seafood, and the sushi bowls with rice. And I'm yearning for more dessert. (laugh) I'm certainly wanting to eat much more!!!! The next Live concert is in Kawasaki City. It's also been a while since our last show at Club Citta. I'll be waiting to see you there. Posted by Matt at 9:38 AM 0 comments Links to this post Anza Myspace Blog 5/27/09 It's time to perform! current mood: hyper After I write this, it'll be time to head to Sendai City. Tonight, the rain is coming down in Tokyo.... All the other members of the band will be traveling by car. But, because of work, I'll be going by bullet train. To be honest, this is the first time I've taken the bullet train in the direction of Sendai City. It's very exciting to be able to make good use of the train this time to get to the show. (heart) I'm looking forward to seeing all the people at Sendai City and Sapporo City! OK? Hey! By the way, the 27th is HPP drummer Batch's Birthday! We're going to party at Sendai City!!! Till then!!! Posted by Matt at 8:37 AM 0 comments Links to this post Monday, June 1, 2009 Anza HPP Blog 5/27/09 Hey guys. (star) Anza here. Is everyone doing alright? HPP is full of energy and fit as a fiddle. (laugh) Oh! The In This Moment Tour went off without a hitch. To everyone who came out to see the shows, Thank you. After this, we had interviews with magazines and the like about the tour, but I'm not sure of all the details of when they will go on sale. Once I find something out, I'll be sure to pass it on. (heart) And now. I wonder, what's so special about this day of May 27th????? Today, Mr. Batch who is Head Phones President's drummer has a birthday! It's true!!! Among the members, it's been a comfort to make Batch part of the band after all he has contributed. We're settled down and a complete band, and he's a great band mate. His superior drumming is going to continue. Right on !!!! So, I want everybody out there to write and wish him a Happy Birthday, OK?!!!! So~, next is Sendai City and Sapporo City. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there with pleasure. Oh Yeah~!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sorry it took so long to getting around to translating this entry. My knee has been really hurting me here lately and I needed a day of where I could sit at my computer and not have to worry whether it would bother me at work. So, for a while at least, I'll just be doing translations on my day off.
