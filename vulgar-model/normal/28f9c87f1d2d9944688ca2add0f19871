Thank you very much for your visit today! What is TV-Free Toddler Time all about? I started this blog as a way of keeping myself accountable to YOU for spending quality time with my 3 children ages 3 and under. I have 6 older children as well, and one in utero, but they can all pretty much entertain themselves. I'd love it if you'd play along with me. Here's how it works... 1. Grab this button and put it on your blog... <a href="http://tvfreetoddlertime.blogspot.com"><img src="http://i943.photobucket.com/albums/ad274/jenwhet/Ihearttv-free.jpg"/></a<br/> 2. Do your best during the week to do at least one 30-minute activity with your toddler(s) each day. If you accomplish this for seven days in a row, leave me a comment on any post, and your name and blog link (if you have one) will be posted on the Smiley Face List every Monday morning. 3. Want more linky love? Just blog about one of your activities (and make sure to take fun photos!), email me your post link at mom2my9 [at] gmail [dot] com, and you could be the featured TV-Free Toddler Time Mom of the Week! So let's have some fun, shall we? If not, I think you need a time-out. payday loan cash advance > TV-Free Toddler Time Moms My Other Blogs...
