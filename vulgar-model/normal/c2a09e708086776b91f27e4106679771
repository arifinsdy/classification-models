We must learn to not rely on the system. We must leave our respected cities and live in trustworthy communities. We need to stop relying on technology. Our only source of knowledge seems to be in a digital form it is extremely easy to cut off any information that may help us resist the up coming genocide. Horde physical books, guides, maps, guns, food, water, tools, metal, first aid supplies, acoustic instruments, generators, human powered vehicles, axes, shovels, pots, pans, fertilizer, medicine, blankets, fabric, etc. We will be re-educated whether we like it or not. Torture will be used regularly. Torture will be a daily routine for all of us. When they murder us they will just say that we committed suicide. Its as easy as that. The funny thing is all of this will be considered legal. Remember the American Indefinite Detention Act? Remember the Patriot Act? What constitution? We have no rights. We are legal slaves. Do not fall victim to the government hypocrisy. Read up on the cambodian genocide, this is what we will be subjected to. Cambodian Genocide Here are some pictures of the people of cambodia that were executed: Pictures From Inside Pol Pots Secret Prison You should also read up on the mass killings in the Stalin era Soviet Union. Soviet Genocide Also read up on the human rights in modern day China, and the treatment of the Falun Gong practitioners. Treatment of Falun Gong Practitioners Chinese Re-education through labor   Resist. Do not let these scum achieve their vision of the future. Do not let them win.

Being forced to do incredibly hard labor. And then being executed with a pick axe or bamboo. Only seven people are documented survivors. Check out these pictures. Its sad how every one of the people were executed.  Victims of the Cambodian killing fields Posted by !sense! at 3:36 PM 1 comments Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook Saturday, March 10, 2012 Work Why do we work for almost nothing. All we have is time. Our time is not worth 8.25/hr. Money is not real. It is as real as santa claus. The lie has become to great.

Posted by !sense! at 9:34 PM 10 comments Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook Friday, March 4, 2011 sorry for the no post vacation I am so fucking sick of this rat race called life. I would love a new job, but I am over being the bitch of the work place. OK. My las place of employment took so much advantage of me. I was their everything, kinda. I am not trying to be sexist so dont start with me there, but being the only guy in a store full of teenagers is a no go. I mean, do not get the wrong idea they were some cool chicks, but the way they treated me was unfair.   First off, all of the sales associates were paid the same, we had the same duties, and we took orders from the same people. Myself being the only straight male, had to do all the heavy lifting and dirty work. So I was the only person who did any heavy lifting. When the store was in liquidation I was stuck doing all of the back breaking trash runs, tearing down fixtures, and any other thing besides sweeping (which I did as well). This kinda pissed me off. Why am I getting paid as much as them if I am doing a lot more work then them. FUCKING FEMINISM IS SLAVERY. that is all Posted by !sense! at 2:19 AM 22 comments Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) About Me !sense!
