are key features to look for in a quality hookah if you are looking to buy a hookah keep the following tips in mind single hose hookahs smoke arguably better than a multiple hose hookahs medium size hookahs often smoke much better than very small or very large hookahs a washable hose is easier to maintain than a traditional hookah thick glass and a sturdy shape are very important for the vase look for clean welds and avoid screw together parts avoid any hookah that uses plastic im not getting enough smoke what am i doing wrong here is a detailed article on how to get more smoke out of hookah this can have many reasons the most common problem is not packing the tobacco right or not making the holes in the aluminum foil the right way make sure that the hookah is completely sealed poor seals are the death of a good session because they let air into the system from points other than the bowl the smoke is harsh what am i doing wrong this means that the tobacco is burning you may need less heat either remove some coal or remove the wind cover the bowl may also be over packed and the tobacco could be touching the foil and burning is smoking hookah safer than smoking cigarette there are many papers on this subject that you can find with a simple google search you get much more smoke from a hookah than a cigarette however the smoke is not nearly as harmful less nicotine as the cigarette smoke smoking hookah is obviously not good for your health make sure you talk to a doctor for correct advice on this topic though how should i clean my hookah take every part of the hookah apart traditional hoses should be cleared of all smoke and hung out to dry rinse washable hoses and blow out as much water as you can hang it over a closet pole so that it can dry properly use a hookah brush and hot water for a thorough cleaning on the stem same thing for the vase how often should i clean my hookah you should clean your hookah quite often it is important that you clean it right after smoking and not before your next smoke otherwise the smell and remainder of the previous smoke stays inside the hookah and makes it much harder to remove if you smoke only similar flavors from this one hookah you can wait longer before the flavors will conflict what size bowl should i buy size of the hookah bowl depends mostly on the length of time you want to smoke the tangiers large funnel bowl can reportedly smoke for  hours the crown hookah mini classic bowl lasts for about an hour but takes a minuscule amount of tobacco and only one piece of charcoal there are countless size variations between these two and there are even some freaky bowls that can handle  grams of tobacco it really depends on the kind of session you want what tobacco should i buy there are many different hookah tobacco brands if you like modern style tobaccos light buzz high smoke volume sweet flavors then brands like fumari and social smoke are good choices nakhla is considered the best brand by many and is the most smoked brand on the market it has very natural flavors and wonderful smoke tangiers is known for having high volume smoke unique flavors and a strong buzz it really depends on what you want from your session what coal should i buy generally speaking there are two types of coals quick light and natural as the name indicates quick light coals are made to start up fast usually  seconds of flaming them with lighter sets them on however ql coals often add unwanted flavors to the tobacco and cost more but they are used for convenience natural coals take longer to light up but they are much better than ql coals they should not add flavor or smell and last longer than ql coals natural coals are the better option for someone smoking at home or in a place where they have access to a fire or stove how many hoses im a big fan of one hose hookahs multiple hose hookahs should only be used when smoking with lots of people but you have to plug the hoses that are not being smoked from so air doesnt get pulled back into the hookah passing the hose and sharing the smoking time is part of the smoking ritual what is hookah called in different languages english hookah spanish narguile or pipe turca french narguil farsi ghelyoon ghelyaan arabic shisha or argile retrieved from httpwwwhookahloungenetwikihookahfaq this page was last modified on  november  at  this page has been
