appendix authors biographical sketch i background and authors qualifications i have been asked by the city of chicago law department to provide an expert opinion on issues related to the effects of tobacco advertising and promotion on youth and the importance of legislation that would restrict the placement of tobacco billboards within the city i have also been asked to describe my qualifications to render these opinions and my involvement as an expert witness in other tobaccorelated litigation a biographical sketch is attached as an appendix to this report it summarizes my professional career a longer and more detailed curriculum vitae has also been made available in brief i am a physician with board certification in preventive medicine and an epidemiologist trained at the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc my current position is director of the center for health promotion and disease prevention at the henry ford health system a large managed care organization in southeast michigan serving approximately  residents of the state i was chief medical officer for the michigan department of public health from  to  and director of the cdcs office on smoking and health from  to  i currently serve as chair of the american medical associations council on scientific affairs and i am editor of tobacco control an international journal published quarterly by the british medical association in this report per the request from the city of chicago law department i will focus primarily on the epidemiologic evidence related to the effects of tobacco advertising and promotion on youth i will not review in any detail the evidence on the psychosocial effects of advertising and promotion eg how the imagery and messages in tobacco advertising appeal to the developmental needs of youth nor will i review the many industry documents that have come to light in recent months and years that bear upon this issue i will base my opinions on my background as a physician as an epidemiologist as one who has conducted substantial research on tobacco advertising and promotion for at least a dozen years and as one who has worked extensively in the field of tobacco and health during the past two decades the research i have performed is documented in the journal articles i have published which are listed in my curriculum vitae two roles in particular have put me in a position where i have been exposed to a breadth of information on this subject one of these was my tenure as director of the cdcs office on smoking and health which is the lead federal office relating to tobacco and health the office produces the annual surgeon generals reports on smoking and health which use a rigorous peerreview process in summarizing the scientific literature in the field and maintains the worlds largest bibliographic database containing technical material on the subject  the other important role is my service since  as editor of tobacco control which is the only journal in the world devoted to this subject serving as editor has ensured my awareness of the pertinent research being conducted in the field i have served as an expert witness in several other tobaccorelated lawsuits including the state attorney general lawsuits filed in mississippi texas and washington state and the broin and engle class actions filed in florida an important role for an epidemiologist  and a physician specializing in preventive medicine  is to identify the antecedents or determinants of disease eliminating or reducing those antecedents will then reduce the incidence or prevalence of disease in this case we know that smoking is a major antecedent in the causation of numerous diseases including cancer heart disease emphysema and stroke we can extend this process further by assessing the antecedents or determinants of behavioral risk factors for disease such as smoking as indicated by the evidence reviewed in this report exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is an antecedent in the initiation of smoking among youth ii how tobacco advertising and promotion affect tobacco consumption the  surgeon generals report the health consequences of smoking  years of progress reviewed the mechanisms by which tobacco advertising and promotion may affect tobacco consumption four direct mechanisms by which advertising and promotion may increase tobacco consumption were discussed advertising and promotion could encourage children or young adults to experiment with tobacco products and initiate regular use advertising and promotion could increase tobacco users daily consumption of tobacco products by serving as a cue to tobacco use advertising and promotion could reduce current tobacco users motivation to quit advertising and promotion could encourage former smokers to resume smoking the surgeon generals report also discussed several indirect mechanisms by which advertising and promotion might increase tobacco consumption one of these is that the ubiquity and familiarity of tobacco advertising and promotion may contribute to an environment in which tobacco use is perceived by users to be socially acceptable or at least less socially objectionable and less hazardous than it is in fact the report reviewed the evidence bearing on these effects although it concluded that no single study would be likely to provide a definitive answer to the question of whether advertising and promotion increase the level of tobacco consumption the report noted that the most comprehensive review of both the direct and indirect mechanisms concluded that the collective empirical experiential and logical evidence makes it more likely than not that advertising and promotion activities do stimulate cigarette consumption substantial research on the effects of cigarette advertising and promotion has been conducted and published since the release of that report in  as a result the surgeon general and the us department of health and human services have extended and strengthened their conclusions about the effects of advertising and promotion on smoking behavior particularly in regards to children and adolescents these stronger and more recent conclusions were published in the surgeon generals  report on smoking and youth see section vi a below and by the us food and drug administration in documents related to its rulemaking on tobacco sales and marketing my own conclusions are similar to those of the surgeon general the department of health and human services and the food and drug administration tobacco advertising and promotion do indeed stimulate cigarette consumption especially among youth iii evidence that advertising and promotion affect overall tobacco consumption several timeseries studies have assessed the relationship between tobacco consumption and tobacco advertising expenditures simply put timeseries analysis is the study of observations taken in a series of instances over time it often uses statistical techniques such as multiple regression a method for distinguishing among competing and simultaneous influences on the end result tobacco consumption in this case it has been used to assess the relationship between tobacco advertising expenditures and tobacco consumption over time taking into account controlling for other potential influences on consumption such as price and income the economics and operational research division of the british department of health in the smee report analyzed the results of  timeseries studies of cigarette advertising including seven in the us seven in the united kingdom two in new zealand and one each in australia and west germany they found that  studies showed positive results ie that higher advertising expenditures are associated with higher tobacco consumption one showed negative results and five showed both positive and negative results the main findings of their review were as follows yeartoyear variations in advertising expenditure within countries there are many studies of this type both for the uk and for other countries particularly the us details of the analysis vary from one study to another but the basic approach is to model the demand for tobacco products by relating annual changes in consumption to corresponding changes in advertising expenditure and in other variables such as price and income some studies have found that advertising has a statistically significant effect on consumption others including our own study have not there are several possible reasons for failure to find a statistically significant effect of advertising including data imperfections and the inherent difficulty of identifying the separate effect of advertising when this is only one of many potential influences on smoking behaviour taken together however the studies point to a more decisive result because the studies differ in specification and data a range of results is always to be expected if however advertising genuinely has no effect on consumption it would also be expected that the number of studies reporting positive and negative results would be much the same in other words some studies would show that advertising increases consumption but others that advertising reduces consumption in practice this symmetry is not observed the great majority of results point in the same direction  towards a positive impact the balance of evidence thus supports the conclusion that advertising does have a positive effect on consumption andrews and franke conducted a metaanalysis of  timeseries studies of tobacco advertising and sales which covered the period from  to  twentyfive of the studies were based on us data and another  used data from the uk the weighted mean advertising elasticity was positive and significantly different from zero meaning that higher advertising expenditures were associated with higher levels of cigarette consumption these findings are especially impressive given a basic limitation of such studies  they assess the effects of the annual fluctuations in advertising expenditures which presumably relate to the least productive slice of expenditure on the reasonable assumption that advertising is subject to diminishing returns one would expect a much greater impact from a total ban on advertising or from a ban on a particular method or medium of advertising eg billboards  which cuts away the most effective core of advertising  than from marginal changes in total advertising expenditures from year to year in a  review of  timeseries studies the new zealand toxic substances board found that  of the studies showed that tobacco advertising significantly affected national cigarette sales the board concluded that advertising is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked increased advertising means more cigarettes smoked and less advertising means fewer smoked the effect of advertising on cigarette consumption can be substantial even a  percent rise in advertising will tend to increase consumption by  percent that is by  million cigarettes in new zealand in a year changes in cigarette consumption of this magnitude will produce significant changes in death rates this can be deduced from the high numbers exposed to the risk the intensity and duration of that exposure and the high relative risks for smokers of a number of common and serious diseases iv countries with tobacco advertising bans have lower consumption or slower increases in consumption than those without bans the new zealand toxic substances board commissioned a study on the relationship between tobacco advertising and tobacco consumption between  and  in  countries with varying levels of controls on advertising the study published in the  report referred to above classified countries into four main categories those allowing tobacco advertising in all media in most media or in a few media and those not allowing tobacco advertising in any media countries prohibiting all tobacco advertising were further subdivided into countries not allowing tobacco advertising for health reasons and those not allowing tobacco advertising for political reasons ie centrally planned eastern european economies that did not during the study period permit advertising of consumables including tobacco the new zealand study found a clear pattern between rate of change in tobacco consumption and the restrictiveness of controls on advertising in countries allowing tobacco advertising in all media per capita tobacco consumption increased annually by  on average consumption decreased on average by  annually in countries with partial bans on advertising and by a similar amount in countries that had banned advertising of any kind for political reasons consumption fell annually by  on average in countries that had banned all tobacco advertising for health reasons furthermore the study found that the percentage of young people who smoke had decreased more rapidly in countries where advertising had been totally banned or severely restricted than in countries where tobacco promotion had been less restricted a later study published in the british journal of addiction used a pooled crosssectional timeseries analysis to examine the relationship among tobacco advertising restrictions price income and tobacco consumption in  oecd countries from  to  see section v b below for a definition of crosssectional the investigators found that tobacco advertising restrictions after  were increasingly associated with lower tobacco consumption the smee report mentioned above reviewed trends in smoking in four countries that banned tobacco advertising norway finland canada and new zealand it reached the following conclusion though there are qualifications for example the bans in canada and new zealand are relatively recent and so may not yet have had their full impact the current evidence available on these four countries indicates a significant effect in each case the banning of advertising was followed by a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors based on this evidence the food and drug administration fda came to the following conclusion in promulgating its rules on tobacco sales and marketing fda finds that the international experience provides empirical evidence that restrictions on tobacco advertising when given appropriate scope and when fully implemented will reduce cigarette and smokeless tobacco use among children and adolescents under the age of  these findings from countrylevel data described above in sections iii and iv have been confirmed by studies on the effects of cigarette advertising at a micro level  ie involving individuals  as described below v tobacco advertising and promotion have material effects on children and adolescents a tobacco advertising and promotion reach children and adolescents in considering the effects of tobacco advertising on children and adolescents the first issue to address is whether advertising and promotion reach children and adolescents although the tobacco and advertising industries deny that advertising is targeted to children  denials that are contradicted by internal industry documents that have surfaced in recent years  the key question is whether minors are exposed to advertising substantial evidence indicates clearly that they are indeed so exposed an example of a study confirming the exposure of children to tobacco advertising was published in the journal of the american medical association jama investigators showed that  of sixyearold children from five different states correctly matched a picture of joe camel with a picture of a cigarette similar to the percentage who recognized the logo of the disney channel a silhouette of mickey mouse  confirmatory evidence came from two studies funded by rj reynolds tobacco company rjr one of these studies found that  of sixyearolds and  of children aged  years could identify joe camel the other study conducted for rjr by roper starch surveyed more than  children aged  of these children  recognized joe camel in both aided and unaided recall  of whom knew that he sold cigarettes further evidence derives from studies measuring childrens recognition of cigarette brands models logos and slogans in cigarette advertisements in which identifying information has been obscured another study published in jama found that students in grades  in five different states were much more likely than adults to recognize joe camel as a character whom they had seen before and to identify the products being advertised and the brand name of the product in a study of  to yearolds in australia chapman and fitzgerald found that children who reported smoking in the last four weeks were almost two times more likely to correctly identify the edited advertisements and to complete the slogans than were children who reported not having smoked during that period similar findings have been reported from georgia massachusetts and north carolina usa the united kingdom  and hong kong additional evidence that tobacco promotions reach children and adolescents comes from studies showing that many youth obtain and use merchandise from cigarette continuity programs eg camel cash marlboro miles much of this merchandise bears cigarette brand names such that children become in essence walking billboards by wearing camel tshirts marlboro caps and so on these programs are advertised heavily on billboards as demonstrated by a photograph i took of a billboard for marlboro gear in front of a toys r us store and a chuck e cheeses pizza establishment which was reproduced with an editorial i wrote on the subjectc  exposure of children and adolescents to cigarette advertising and promotion is not surprising given the ubiquity of and heavy expenditures for these marketing activities in recent years cigarette companies have spent more than  billion per year  per second to advertise and promote cigarettes children and adolescents are exposed to most of the media used for tobacco advertising especially billboards  see section vi below  the institute of medicine in an expert committee report entitled growing up tobacco free reviewed the evidence on the extent of tobacco advertising and its effects on youth with respect to youth exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion it concluded tobacco advertising is characterized by images and themes that are especially appealing to adolescents and some are appealing to children in addition a large proportion of promotional expenditures associate use of tobacco with activities and products that are attractive to children and youths the sheer amount of expenditures for advertising and promotion assures that young people will be exposed to these messages on a massive scale it is clear that societys efforts to discourage young people from smoking are obstructed  and perhaps fatally undermined  by the industrys efforts to portray their dangerous products in a positive light b tobacco advertising and promotion increase tobacco use by children and adolescents  crosssectional studies many crosssectional studies have found that smoking status and smoking initiation among youth are correlated with awareness recognition and approval of tobacco advertisements and promotions exposure to tobacco advertisements and promotions receptivity to tobacco advertising and promotion receipt or ownership of tobacco promotional items and a feeling that cigarette ads make them want to smoke a cigarette    crosssectional studies evaluate correlations at a single point in time although the correlations between smoking behavior and cigarette advertising in these studies are compelling when considering the total body of evidence  which includes many different study designs study populations and investigators  the crosssectional nature of these studies does not allow a definitive conclusion about the direction of causality for example if a crosssectional study shows that teenage smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to like cigarette ads two explanations with opposite directions of causality between the associated variables are possible a teens who like cigarette ads are more likely to become smokers over time than teens who dont like the ads or b teens who become smokers are more likely to develop a liking of the ads than teens who dont become smokers longitudinal studies which assess correlations at two or more points in time can determine the temporal relationship between two associated variables and hence the causal relationship between the two two longitudinal studies of youth smoking in relation to tobacco advertising are described below  longitudinal studies two important longitudinal studies followed up on earlier crosssectional investigations in a crosssectional survey of  primary school children  years old in new south wales australia the children were asked whether cigarettes should be advertised logistic regression was used to determine the relative importance of several factors including approval of cigarette advertising in relation to the childrens smoking status approval of advertising was the second most important predictor of smoking status after friends smoking behavior but ahead of siblings smoking behavior amount of money available to spend weekly sex age and parents smoking status the investigators then assessed changes in smoking behavior over  months among these  children in a longitudinal study design this design allowed the investigators to assess the strength of the association between several personal and social variables and the process of adopting or quitting smoking four study groups were defined a children who became smokers adopters b those who remained nonsmokers c those who became nonsmokers quitters and d those who remained smokers as noted by the authors children who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to become smokers as children who disapproved with the smoking behaviour of those who were ambivalent about advertising falling between that of the other two groups the smoking adoption rate per  children was  for those approving of cigarette advertising  for those not approving and  for those who said they dont know a difference which was highly statistically significant p   similarly children who disapproved of cigarette advertising were significantly more likely to quit smoking than those who approved of it pierce and colleagues have also used both crosssectional and longitudinal study designs to establish the relationship between cigarette advertising and smoking initiation among youth they have defined constructs for susceptibility to smoking and receptivity to tobacco marketing with regard to the former adolescents with no smoking experience are asked two questions to probe the likelihood of future smoking do you think you will try a cigarette soon and if one of your best friends were to offer you a cigarette would you smoke any answer other than no or definitely not to both questions results in classifying an adolescent as susceptible to smoking in an earlier crosssectional study evans et al defined an index of receptivity to tobacco marketing the index was based on the total score from five items a whether the adolescent felt that a tobacco advertisement contained at least one of nine messages eg smoking is enjoyable it helps people relax it helps people stay thin b whether the adolescent could name a cigarette brand in response to either of two questions  what is the name of the cigarette brand of your favorite cigarette advertisement and of all the cigarette advertisements you have seen which do you think attracts your attention the most c whether the adolescent could name a cigarette brand in response to the question if you wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes tomorrow what brand do you think that you would buy d whether the adolescent said yes to the question have you ever bought or received for free any product which promotes a tobacco brand or was distributed by a tobacco company and e whether the adolescent said yes to the question do you think that you would ever use a tobacco industry promotional item such as a tshirt using data from  adolescent neversmokers from the  california tobacco survey in a crosssectional logistic regression analysis evans et al found that receptivity to tobacco marketing was independently associated with susceptibility to smoking after adjustment for sociodemographic variables including age sex and raceethnicity and perceived school performance adolescents who scored  or more on the index of receptivity to tobacco marketing were  times more likely to be susceptible to smoking than those who scored  even adolescents who scored  on the index were twice as likely to be susceptible pierce et al extended these findings in a longitudinal study design a total of  of the adolescents who were not susceptible to smoking when first interviewed in  were reinterviewed in  in a measure of receptivity to tobacco marketing similar to that used by evans et al pierce et al defined receptivity as minimal if the respondent did not name a brand when asked to identify the brand advertised the most on billboards or in magazines recently seen if respondents also had a favorite advertisement they would be considered to have moderate receptivity respondents who said that they had bought or received a promotional item from a tobacco company or that they would ever use a promotional item were classified as highly receptive to advertising pierce and colleagues then investigated the progression toward smoking of the nonsusceptible neversmokers  in a logistic regression analysis of predictors of which adolescents progressed toward smoking pierce et al found that the baseline receptivity in  to tobacco industry promotional activities was strongly related to which adolescents progressed toward smoking among those who were assessed as having a minimal level of receptivity  progressed toward smoking compared with this group those who had a favorite advertisement but who were not willing to use a promotional item the moderate level were  more likely to progress toward smoking which is a statistically significant increase compared with those at the minimal level those with a high level of receptivity at least willing to use a promotional item were almost  times more likely to progress toward smoking which was highly statistically significant the authors estimated that  of all smoking experimentation in california between  and  can be attributed to tobacco promotional activities translating to experimentation by  adolescents nationally in summary the evidence from these two longitudinal studies  extends the findings from many crosssectional studies and confirms that awareness and approval of tobacco advertising and promotion and receptivity to tobacco marketing are causal factors in smoking initiation among youth  relationship between cigarette advertising and brand preference among youth another line of evidence indicating the effect of tobacco advertising and promotion on youth is the relationship between cigarette advertising and brand preference among youth in a study of students in two junior high schools in the chicago area seventh and eighthgrade children who smoked were asked to view a series of cigarette advertisements and to rate how much they liked each ad the investigators found that the students cigarette buying preferences closely paralleled the perceived appeal of the cigarette advertisements particularly compelling evidence is the huge increase in teenage use of camel cigarettes coinciding with rj reynolds youthoriented joe camel advertising campaign    furthermore studies have shown that youth find joe camel to be appealing  similarly tobacco advertising campaigns targeting women beginning in the late s ie virginia slims were associated with a major increase in smoking initiation among adolescent girls in general the brand choices of adolescent smokers reflect the brands with the largest advertising budgets  especially noteworthy is the finding by pollay and colleagues that the relationship between brand choices and brand advertising is about three times stronger among teenagers than among adults based on this area of research the fda came to the following conclusion  these studies are evidence that when considered together form a coherent pattern that establishes the role that advertising plays in young peoples smoking behavior  other evidence king et al showed that cigarette brands popular among adolescent smokers are more likely than adult brands to be advertised in magazines with high youth readerships this suggests that exposure to advertising affects smoking behavior and cigarette brand preference among youth the evidence summarized in this section v b taken as a whole makes a persuasive case that tobacco advertising and promotion increase tobacco use among children and adolescents vi billboards represent a particularly effective and intrusive medium for advertising in general and for promotion of cigarettes in particular especially to children there are a number of reasons why tobacco billboards warrant special concern with respect to their impact on youth billboards are a favorite medium for tobacco advertising billboards are intrusive and cannot be avoided billboards are in peoples neighborhoods and are constantly exposing youth and adults to unsolicited messages and billboards in urban innercity environments are more likely to carry tobacco and alcohol advertisements often targeted to racial and ethnic minorities a billboards are a favorite medium for tobacco advertising there are two ways in which we can look at expenditures for tobacco advertising on billboards the first is the proportion of total tobacco marketing expenditures devoted to billboards this gives us a measure of how important billboards are in tobacco company marketing efforts the second is the proportion of total advertising in various media devoted to tobacco this gives us a measure of the extent to which tobacco advertising dominates those media according to data submitted by tobacco companies to the federal trade commission the companies have used outdoor media heavily through the years in comparison to other print media in  the last year for which data are available cigarette companies spent  million on advertising in outdoor media in the united states  of total cigarette advertising and promotional expenditures for that year compared to  million  for advertising at the point of sale  million  in magazines  million  in transit media and  million in newspapers  in other words billboards continue to be a preferred medium for print advertising of cigarettes if we consider total advertising expenditures for different media we see that tobacco advertising has dominated outdoor media to a far greater extent than it has other print media my own research showed that in  cigarette advertising expenditures accounted for more than onefifth  of all advertising in outdoor media  million out of a total of  million compared to  for magazines  million out of a total of  billion and  for newspapers  million out of a total of  billion in  the figures were   and  respectively in  cigarettes were the most heavily advertised product or service in outdoor media the second most heavily advertised in magazines after passenger cars and the third most heavily advertised in newspapers after passenger cars and airlines of the seven companies with the largest advertising expenditures in outdoor media in  six were cigarette companies also in that year tobacco advertising expenditures for eightsheet  by  feet billboards were  million  about half the total expenditures for that medium  million a subsequent analysis for the year  showed that cigarettes remained the most heavily advertised product or service in outdoor media compared to a ranking of second in magazines after passenger cars and sixth in newspapers in  cigarette advertising expenditures accounted for   and  of total advertising expenditures in outdoor media magazines and newspapers respectively as these figures show billboards remained a favorite medium for cigarette advertising even though the tobacco industry was gradually shifting its marketing dollars from traditional forms of print advertising into promotional activities such as distribution of free samples and coupons sponsorship of sporting and entertainment events valueadded offers eg buy one get one free  b billboards are intrusive and cannot be avoided in packer corp v state of utah the us supreme court upheld legislation in the state of utah that prohibited all tobacco advertising in outdoor media and at the point of sale against a challenge based on the th amendment equal protection clause in its opinion the court approvingly cited a passage from the utah supreme courts decision upholding that law page  which speaks to the intrusiveness of billboards billboards street car signs and placards and such are in a class by themselves advertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers on the streets and in street cars to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer the young people as well as the adults have the message of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce in the case of newspapers and magazines there must be some seeking by the one who is to see and read the advertisement the radio can be turned off but not so the billboard or street car placard these distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class the billboard industrys own marketing material emphasizes the intrusive nature of the medium outdoor  you cant zap it you cant ignore it it asks little time but leaves a long impression outdoor is right up there day and night lurking waiting for another ambush materials from the outdoor advertising industry in chicago make similar albeit less colorful claims the eller media company notes that its bulletins assure dominance in selected areas and are positioned on highly visible traffic locations such as expressways primary arteries and major intersections rotary bulletins provide full market coverage  to ensure total saturation of the market the companys wallscape sign on the sides of buildings towers above the streets creating a spectacular landmark  and provides dominance in key market sic ellers sheet posters are located on primary and secondary streets where traffic volumes are high  provide complete and instantaneous coverage of the market  deliver exposures to both residents as well as commuter traffic  create rapid consumer topofmind awareness  and provide continuous presence up to  hours every day in chicago eller notes it takes a combination of  poster panels to achieve a daily circulation number of impressions equal to fifty percent of chicagos population showings can be specialized to reach various niches within the overall market noticeably absent from ellers materials is any mention of avoiding youth exposure to advertising for agerestricted products such as tobacco and alcohol on the contrary the materials note that outdoor advertising displays are giant dramatic and visible  their presence in the market ensures nearly everyone will be exposed to them  they generate massive awareness of an advertising message outdoor reaches a highly mobile audience  where people live work and socialize emphasis added c billboards are in peoples neighborhoods and are constantly exposing youth and adults to unsolicited messages as judge hargrove noted in penn advertising of baltimore inc v mayor of baltimore a billboard is a constant fixture in a neighborhood it looms over children every day while they walk to school and every time they play in their neighborhood thus forming an inescapable part of their daily life eightsheet  by  feet billboards are particularly effective in encroaching on people in their neighborhood because they are smaller than the typical highway billboards are low to the ground and are close to the street and thus to sidewalks cars and school buses as noted above in  tobacco advertising expenditures for eightsheet billboards were  million  about half the total expenditures for that medium  million voluntary codes by the billboard industry have been ineffective in preventing youth exposure to tobacco billboards eg the code of the outdoor advertising agencies of america which recommends that its member companies not advertise tobacco and alcohol within  feet of schools and other areas where underage youth congregate evidence presented to the lansing michigan city council which recently banned tobacco billboards in that city showed a substantial overlap between tobacco billboards and school bus routes a similar problem has been reported from the united kingdom where many tobacco billboards are found near schools in violation of a voluntary agreement on cigarette advertising between the government and cigarette manufacturers in the roper starch study conducted for rj reynolds tobacco company mentioned above children  years old who said they knew joe camel were asked please tell me the ways that you might have seen or heard about this character the largest proportion  said the information came from a billboard advertisement followed by an advertisement in a magazine  an advertisement in a store  or from a tshirt  on the other hand for other cartoon characters in advertisements  eg the energizer bunny ronald mcdonald and the keebler elves  recognition based on billboard exposure was between  and  further evidence that tobacco billboards are reaching and probably influencing youth comes from a survey conducted for the trade publication advertising age it showed that  of children  years old said they most often saw cigarette advertising on billboards moreover  of those  years of age cited billboards as the predominant advertising medium for tobacco products d billboards in urban innercity environments are more likely to carry tobacco and alcohol advertisements often targeted to racial and ethnic minorities a number of studies have shown that billboards in urban innercity environments are more likely to carry tobacco and alcohol advertisements often targeted to racial and ethnic minorities a survey in baltimore before that city banned tobacco and alcohol billboards showed that of  billboards in the city  were located in predominantly poor african american neighborhoods  of those billboards carried tobacco or alcohol ads compared to  in white neighborhoods the detroit planning commission conducted a study of the  billboards in the city in  it found that advertisements for tobacco and alcohol products accounted for  to  of all billboards in lower income detroit compared to  to  in higher income areas the two billboards found to be the tallest and largest both advertised tobacco a chicago lung association survey found  more billboards in predominantly african american wards in chicago than in white wards in washington dc few alcohol and tobacco billboards were found in ward  which is predominantly white however  of billboards advertised alcohol or tobacco in wards  and  which are heavily african american a similar pattern of targeting ethnic and poor neighborhoods was found in st louis atlanta and san francisco based on the evidence cited elsewhere in this report it is reasonable to assume that the higher density of tobacco billboards in poor ethnic neighborhoods is responsible for smoking by large numbers of young people in racial and ethnic populations in urban areas this is a matter of great concern given the recent report that smoking prevalence increased substantially from  to  among african american high school students from  to  and among hispanic students from  to  vii conclusions a conclusions of the  surgeon generals report based on much of the evidence cited above the  surgeon generals report preventing tobacco use among young people reached the following conclusions about tobacco advertising and promotion young people continue to be a strategically important market for the tobacco industry young people are currently exposed to cigarette messages through print media including outdoor billboards and through promotional activities cigarette advertising uses images rather than information to portray the attractiveness and function of smoking human models and cartoon characters in cigarette advertising convey independence healthfulness adventureseeking and youthful activities  themes correlated with psychosocial factors that appeal to young people cigarette advertisements capitalize on the disparity between an ideal and actual selfimage and imply that smoking may close the gap cigarette advertising appears to affect young peoples perceptions of the pervasiveness image and function of smoking since misperceptions in these areas constitute psychosocial risk factors for the initiation of smoking cigarette advertising appears to increase young peoples risk of smoking b conclusions of the food and drug administration the food and drug administration having reviewed the same body of evidence discussed in this report has come to the following conclusion fda recognizes that advertising may not be the most important factor in a childs decision to smoke however the studies cited by the agency establish that it is a substantial contributing and therefore material factor the proper question is not is advertising the most important cause of youth initiation but rather does fda have a solid body of evidence establishing that advertising encourages young peoples tobacco use such that fda could rationally restrict that advertising the answer to this question is yes emphasis in original c my own conclusions my own conclusions are similar to those of the  surgeon generals report and the food and drug administration the evidence reviewed in this report clearly indicates that tobacco advertising and promotion increase aggregate tobacco consumption in part through a material effect on smoking by youth the several lines of evidence that lead to these conclusions include timeseries studies from several countries showing a relationship between tobacco consumption and tobacco advertising expenditures at the national level studies showing that countries with tobacco advertising bans have lower tobacco consumption or slower increases in consumption than those without bans studies showing that tobacco advertising and promotion reach children and adolescents numerous crosssectional studies showing that smoking status and smoking initiation are correlated with awareness recognition and approval of tobacco advertisements and promotions exposure to tobacco advertisements and promotions receptivity to tobacco advertising and promotion receipt or ownership of tobacco promotional items and a feeling that cigarette ads make them want to smoke a cigarette two longitudinal studies showing that approval of cigarette advertising and receptivity to tobacco marketing predict the likelihood of taking up smoking or moving through the process of smoking initiation and studies showing relationships between cigarette brand preference among youth and the following variables a cigarette advertising expenditures for certain brands b the use of youthoriented imagery in certain advertising eg joe camel and c the degree to which teenagers like different ads billboards are a special source of concern because  they are a favorite medium for tobacco advertising  they are intrusive and cannot be avoided  they are in peoples neighborhoods and are constantly exposing youth and adults to unsolicited messages and  billboards in urban innercity environments are more likely to carry tobacco and alcohol advertisements often targeted to racial and ethnic minorities because legislation prohibits the sale of tobacco to minors because tobacco advertising and promotion encourage minors to buy and use tobacco products and because tobacco billboards are a prime medium through which advertising and promotion accomplish these effects i believe that implementation of legislation banning or limiting tobacco billboards in the city of chicago will have a direct and material benefit on the welfare of the city and its children and adolescents viii references us department of health and human services reducing the health consequences of smoking  years of
