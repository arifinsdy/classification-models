tollison robert d toms zach towns edolphus tribe laurence tripp linda according to the february   issue of newsweek a tobacco lobbyist named william hecht helped place linda tripp in a white house job during the bush administration after the  election tripp stayed on at the white house as a confidential assistant to white house advisor bernie nussbaum a senior member of tobacco law firm wachtel lipton rosen  katz which happens to be one of the leading law firms representing the tobacco industry later tripp turned over her accumulated lewinsky tapes to wachtel lipton partner george conway who gave them to james moody no apparent tobacco connection who gave them to starr   conway was the author of the brief that persuaded the us supreme court to permit the paula jones case to proceed newsweek reported that conway never told his partners that he was active on this case   tripp sources told newsday that tripp taped conversations with lewinsky partly out of a desire to seek revenge against the administration over its handling of the july   death of foster her former boss tripp was the last white house staffer to see foster alive tuckson reed v tye joe b u ubell earl udow al pm scientist may   wrote memo on philip morris usa interoffice stationery stating that rival brand kool had the highest nicotine delivery of any kingsize on the market this ties in with the information we have from focus group sessions and other sources that suggest that kool is considered to be good for after marijuana to maintain the high or for mixing with marijuana or instead he wrote that kools high nicotine is a reason for its success and that we should pursue this thought in developing a menthol entry   the lessened taste resulting from the lowered tar can be masked by high menthol or other flavors many menthol smokers say they are not looking for high tobacco taste anyway   a widely held theory holds that most people smoke for the narcotic effect relaxing sedative that comes from the nicotine the taste comes from the tar particulate matter delivery    although more people talk about taste it is likely that greater numbers smoke for the narcotic value that comes from the nicotine upton arthur c  uydess ian v varella luis velcher gary viscusi w kevin author making the risky decision van housen thomas package designer moonlight tobacco brands w wade charles waite cl
