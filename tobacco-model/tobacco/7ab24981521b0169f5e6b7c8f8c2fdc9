fumari white peach shisha review  hookah lounge blog loading forums blog hookah wiki pictures lounge directory fumari white peach shisha review by nima on march   as a general rule i like my hookah shisha to be contained in some sort of container with a lid many would consider this a trivial component of hookah smoking but im under the impression that it keeps the shisha fresher for a longer period of time not only that but once you get down to the last scraps of shisha it is much easier to clear out a hard container than it is a flexible bag this is one reason i was skeptical about trying out fumari shisha of which i had only recently become aware nevertheless their white peach flavor looked appealing so i bought a pack and brought it home with me to try after setting coals onto my stove burner and cleaning the other components of my hookah i set about loading my vortex bowl the first thing i noticed about this particular shisha was both the smell and texture a very powerful peach scent was emitted from the bag but yet it was not overly sweet sometimes other hookah shisha flavors starbuzz brand in particular smell overpoweringly sweet with this white peach flavor it smelled just about right the texture i noticed also was what you would expect from any hookah shisha in the past ive realized that some shisha can get a grainy feel to it if there is too much sugar in the tobacco resulting in an overly sweet smoking session after i finished loading the bowl i placed the coals on top and a wind cover over the entire bowl i like to take this last step to speed up warming the bowl and shisha otherwise it may take several minutes for the hookah to begin smoking properly the smoke comes out thin at first but becomes thicker and thicker with each progressive pull fumari shisha tastes very much as it smells and a powerful peach taste filled my mouth i continued to smoke it with the wind cover on to see how long it would take for the smoke to get harsh but surprisingly it never did the same strong peach taste remained in my mouth without becoming too hot and thats a lot more than i can say for some other shisha brands another pleasing aspect of this fumari shisha is that at least with this white peach flavor it doesnt taste too sweet i mentioned earlier how some shisha brands and flavors tend to sweeten their tobacco too much for my taste fumari on the other hand retains strong flavor without going over the top with sweeteners i continued to smoke the white peach shisha for two sessions replacing the coals once the shisha lost flavor about halfway through the second session but never became harsh which is a common occurrence during round two overall i was pleasantly surprised with fumari brand hookah tobacco regardless of the fact that it comes in a pouch it is worthwhile to note that this brand of shisha is only available in g pouches which may work to your advantage to maximize satisfaction and maximize the amount of flavors you try weve all mistakenly bought a g or larger size container of a flavor we later realized isnt really that great i especially liked the fact that fumari was able to retain a powerful flavor without being overpoweringly sweet its definitely worth a smoke or two and as the packaging says prepare yourself for a strikingly fresh smoking experience you can also check out our wiki page for fumari white peach this post was a guest blog post by my good friend torsten from hookah happiness leave a comment name  email  website notify me of followup comments via email notify me of new posts by email previous post nakhla mix shisha on the beach flavored hookah tobacco next post tangiers noir kashmir prune flavored hookah tobacco search the blog categories comics  daily hookah  hookah contests  hookah lounges  hookah news  hookah tips  reviews  subscribe to our feed recent posts enjoying hookah indoors tangiers noir kashmir prune flavored hookah tobacco fumari white peach shisha review nakhla mix shisha on the beach flavored hookah tobacco nakhla double apple flavored hookah tobacco in the box hookah in space thursday comic top blog articles water levels and hookah bases hookah on airplane what is the best hookah hookah etiquette why isnt my hookah smoking enjoying hookah indoors top  nakhla flavors get smart with the thesis wordpress theme from diythemes wordpress admin wait leave feedback about us contact us privacy copyright   hookahloungenet
