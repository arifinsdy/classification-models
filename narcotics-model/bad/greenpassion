Hi Everyone!

This is my first post on Greenpassion, but I've been lurking for quite some time. I want to contribute a little bit to our collective knowledge of cultivating "our plant".

10 days ago ( Jan 11, 2011...today is Jan 21, 2011) :

I chopped a very large LST/topped monster male that was Vegging in a 3 gallon pot of soil/coco. I cut off about 90% of the plant material and left the rest attached to the rootball. I needed the pot so I dumped the entire plant out, removed the coco and dirt, and left the boy out to the elements to die! Roots exposed and all.

I'm in the Pacific Northwest on the Canadian side, and its been cold with temperatures never going above 12 C or so, and dipping below Zero at night (-4 c). Also, my 3rd floor balcony is mostly obstructed by a massive grandaddy tree family! Nearly no direct sunlight at all on that balcony, and its northern winter light.

Well, low and behold I check on it 10 days later, and its still alive! It hasn't wilted and was growing toward the sunlight, albeit slowly. Wow! Herb is resilient!

I'm curious to see what it will do, So I put it into a 2L Pop bottle pot,top dressed and covered up the roots with soil, and put it up on a chair. Will it make it through the whole winter?! Any bets?

Cheers,
Mike

it will probably make it, just grow slow and not very healthily. You will also get necrotic tissue patches as the water in the plant freezes and bursts the plant cells.

they recommend not watering when it can freeze in the roots so try to avoid that.

I'm glad to contribute to our learning here. 'nuff free riding on you folks for me.

I think you are right, I won't water, but just leave it and let it foliar feed (today is 97% humidity), and live off its roots. I


I believe that if i would have left more of the foliage attached that it would have killed him. Maybe a lesson that can be learned here it that if we have an outdoor plant vegetating (planted late perhaps or started indoors) in a temperate climate like Coastal British Columbia, it can be kept alive if the ratio of its roots to foliage mass is somewhere around 3:1. My theory anyway.


Here is what I chopped, now ten days old and left outside. Its all wilted and dead-looking compared to the surviving plant. LST ropes still attached. Sigh, Attached File  Photo 29.jpg   118.21K   9 downloads Believe me, it was once bushy, big and beautiful!

great post mike... knowing, learning and SEEING  sommat are 3 different things....ya bought em all together hehehhehe rotflmaogif

Warmer roots will allow a plant to survive cold temps and keep growing...they get torpid in growth when it's cold. 

If you can place the soda bottle pot into a bucket with styrofoam packing in the base of the bucket and between the pot and bucket, the plant might handle the cold even better :0 hehehe

glad to have you here

I do have to say though that actually major fan leaves help the plant deal with temperature shifts so by removing foiage it would stress the plant from removing it, from not having the stored nutrients available any more and also because it cant adjust to inopportune temps anymore

remember, it is a weed so it will grow, but my money says that if it was female that youve stressed it enough that it wouldve gone hermie

also what i meant was that you can water, but dont when it is below freezing or will be soon
