        I saw once in an interview that Johnny Carson said he tried it. He actually said this once on his show, too.

        Russle Brand has also smoked weed.

        Tbh, theres way too many people to list, SO many people have or still do smoke it, you'd think the government would just realise that no ones died yet, so why is it still illegal.

        I thought drugs were illegal because they're dangerous, but everyone knows, incuding the governments, that weed isnt harmful.

        When will they realise that their idiots, and people mock them.

        There is an abundance of information as to why marijuana is illegal. Use google, check my post history, anything..

        Just because a large amount of people do it, doesen't justify it being legal.

        If I compiled a list of every person that has ever exceeded the speed limit (ie: every driver who has ever driven on a highway before) it would basically consist of every person known to man. Speeding is still illegal.

        I break the law every single day by smoking pot and driving over the speed limit, and sometimes a combination of the two. All something being illegal means to me is to use your best judgement. Unfortunately, people can't control themselves and their actions since the beginning of time.. and thats why things need to be illegal. Before there were "laws", why do you think religions were started? The world needed a way to control society, and the understanding of a superior being judging your actions and determining your fate or afterlife(s) was just a perfect idea, and everyone believed it and it worked for a really long time, and still currently works to a lesser degree. Law today works the same way. Police enforcement work to control and regulate society.

        There is a LOT of crime involved with Marijuana. A lot of you just don't live in the areas to experience it on a daily basis, so you can't understand where the justifications are coming from.

        Bullshit. The reason weed is illegal is not because people cannot control themselves. It's because it is currently more profitable for our government if it is banned. Religion, in my opinion, is less a guideline and more a way of manipulating us. The dirty pigs at the top of this plutocracy don't pass laws for OUR own good: the pass them for THEY'RE own good.

        Although there may be alot of crime revolving around weed, what would happen if we legalized it? ALL that crime would go away.

        I didn't say that the reason weed is illegal is because people can not control themselves.. I said the reason we needed laws, or some sort of regulation over society in the first place, is because people can not control themselves. Back then, there was no consequential thought given to killing or stealing. Thus, my reference to religion and how this began a concept that evolved in the beginning of time as a way to regulate society. The reason weed is illegal is because it got mixed up in the flawed society regulators, the government.

        What would happen if we legalized it??

        Industries would take over it and it would be government regulated! Marijuana would go the same way with tobacco, and rolled up with other harmful and addictive chemicals and sold at extremely high costs due to supply and demand, the current basis of our economy incase anyone didn't know allready. That would suck.

        While it would be marketed, it probably won't get any addictive chemicals added to it. Tobacco is naturally addictive because of its nicotine. Marijuana has no such chemical. If what you're saying is true, how come our soft drinks (example) don't have added nicotine to make them addictive. We can't keep weed illegal because of what people may market it with. Tobacco has many chemicals such as pestisides. Marijuana will not have these because it naturally needs no such repelent. Even if they do add something to it, considering all the other disgusting biproducts and shit we already consume it won't make much difference. Also, there will probably be an "organic marijuana" if it DOES get chemical additives.

        Tobacco industries have done everything in their power in order to expand their business without the slightest disregard for health. They add completely unnatural and absolutely ridiculous chemicals to cigarettes that are not related to pure tobacco in any way. This way, people become addicted and they make more money. Coca Cola contained high amounts of caffeine and cocaine before they werent allowed to.. Which is why everything is now based upon the Pure Food and Drug Act.

        Industries are all about money, and will do anything in order to make it. Do you have any idea how desireable legal Marijuana would be? People use it enough now that its illegal, the desire would rise even more once it were made legal and acceptable. Anything that would grow that big would be ran by huge industries. Alcohol went the same way. Alcohol and Tobacco industries are enough to worry about without adding another form of legal intoxication, while the other two have caused more than enough problems.

        Weed is just something I never want to be associated with all that bullshit.

        Yes, industries are definetly all about making money, but that's capitalism. It's wrong to outlaw something just because there is a danger it will get fucked up. There will always be home-grown marijuana (just like organic apples, etc). I highly doubt someone will hope to fill marijuana with addictive chemicals, because of the fear that people won't use it. Would you use addictive marijuana? I sure as hell won't. I can only see good things in legalizing. I know we live in completely different cultures, but hell, look at Holland. Does the weed there have addictive substances added? What about Jamaica? No. So why American? One of the main reasons pot is so attractive is that it ISN'T ADDICTIVE. A corporation cannot possibly take an entire plant and change it completely. If people don't want to get the chemicals then they will simply do what we do now.

        This is the most ignorant statement I've ever seen on these forums, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to take any further posts from you seriously.
