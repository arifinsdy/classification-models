I need to replace them with new coats. However, I’ve been looking around the internet for the scrubs store that would give me discounts or has the lower price at all compared to the others. If you have any ideas about where to get some discount scrubs in the net, please let me know then. My old lab white coat has been exposed to any chemicals in the lab causing the colours fade plus washing. How are you going to take care your coats anyway? Can you also give me some more tips for that? My colleagues are changing their coats every other day. That way, they say that they can preserve the color to fade a little bit so that it will last longer.
