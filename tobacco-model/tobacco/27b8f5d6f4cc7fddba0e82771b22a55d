long time to light and require a constant heat source like a campfire or stove burner coco nara made from compressed carbonized coconut shells fairly expensive but very high quality long lasting and very clean see coco nara hookah coals page for more information coco mazaya a coconut charcoal made by coconara cheaper than the original coconara coals and in a slightly different shape in the form
