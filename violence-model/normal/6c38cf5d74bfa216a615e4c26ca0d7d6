The US$275 BRXL-PC6U2-BK burner requires a single USB 2.0 connection functions though a second is required for 4x writing speeds. Hitting shelves this week in Japan, the burner requires BR-R XL discs which will set you back $50 or $60 each. Wow!

Since then, OLED applications in television have been relatively quiet. Today though, Sony has announced a couple of new OLED monitors aimed not at the consumer couch potato market, but TV and movie production companies. Available in 25-inch (BVM-E250) and 17-inch (BVM-E170) display sizes, the TRIMASTER EL OLED master monitors features 1080p resolution, HDMI, Ethernet, DisplayPort, SD-SDI, 3G-SDI and HD-SDI ports, and an aluminum body. Both models will be available July 1 in Japan with converted prices of $16, 000 for the 17-inch model and $29, 000 for the 25-inch model. Ouch!

Sure, projectors are small enough to lug around in a car or on a plane these days, but screens really aren't known to be portable. Epson is looking to fix this with the release of its ES1000 Ultra Portable Tabletop Projection Screen. Weighing only 6.5 pounds and measuring a compact 34.5 inches when closed, the ES1000 fits easily pretty well anywhere including in overhead luggage bins. It is designed to open in about 30 seconds, measures 50 inches diagonally and accommodates both standard 4:3 and widescreen 16:9 aspect ratios. The ES1000 is now available from Epson's website (currently out of stock) for $129.99 which includes free ground shipping.

No, me neither. But apparently Toshiba does. This morning the company announced the D-BW500, a combination VHS, DVD and Blu-ray player with a 320 GB hard drive crammed into its shell. The unit allows users to copy old VHS movies onto Blu-ray, DVD or the disc drive and includes REGZA link, an SHDC card slot for JPEG and AVCHD viewing, a USB port and a double digital TV tuner. The Toshiba D-BW500 will ship in Japan within the next few days for the bargain price (cough, cough!) of US$860.

This means that you'll now be able to plug in a USB drive directly into your Roku player and play back a variety of file formats including MKV, MP4, MOV, WMV/ASF, MP3, AAC, JPG and PNG files. There aren't official release notes available right now but it is known that the USB media player support will require firmware version 2.9, build 1529 to work correctly. Via Zatz Not Funny!

Samsung has announced today that it will include Lovefilm movie streaming by way of application on all of its UK Blu-ray players. The app will be activated by a Lovefilm subscription of Â£5.99 or above and give customers access to thousands of movies via Samsung's Internet@TV service.

Not because it's expensive, requires uncomfortable glasses, causes headaches, or any other of the usual complaints - but because the evolution of our species has never requiredour eyeballs to focus and converge at different points. From the Chicago Sun-Times: The biggest problem with 3D, though, is the "convergence/focus" issue. A couple of the other issues -- darkness and "smallness" -- are at least theoretically solvable. But the deeper problem is that the audience must focus their eyes at the plane of the screen -- say it is 80 feet away. This is constant no matter what. But their eyes must converge at perhaps 10 feet away, then 60 feet, then 120 feet, and so on, depending on what the illusion is. So 3D films require us to focus at one distance and converge at another. And 600 million years of evolution has never presented this problem before. All living things with eyes have always focussed and converged at the same point. In a nutshell, our eyeballs make it nearly impossible - without another few million years of HDTV-related evolutionary adaptations - to properly process 3D images. What do you think about 3D? Will it ever truly catch on?

Lovefilm, in which Amazon already has a minority stake, is the European version of Netflix, operating a DVD rental service (originally purchased from Amazon) and streaming video to the Playstation 3, some TVs and computers. The deal, expected to be completed by the end of March, is a strategic move again both Netflix, which hasn't expanded into Europe yet, and Apple's iTunes which does offer service to Europe.

The 3DS is a dual-screen unit - a touchscreen bottom screen and a 3D upper screen. The glasses free console runs on two 266 MHz ARM processors, comes with a 2 GB SD card for expansion and a charging cradle as opposed to a plug-in connection. It will also have a gyroscope and accelerometer so it can sense motion. LED lights act as indicators on the unit with a green light meaning the unit is fully charged, a red light meaning the battery is low, and an orange light indicating the presence of a friend online. Pilotwings Resort, Nintendogs and Cats, Steeldiver (a submarine game), Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time 3-D and Kid Icarus: Uprising will all be available when the unit launches next month for the equivalent of US$300.

Able to produce an 80-inch, 1280 x 800 XGA resolution picture from only 34-inches away, the PLC WL-2503 pumps out 2500 lumens of brightness, features Sanyo's PJ Network Interface for wired networking, a 4000 hour lamp and filter life, blackboard/colorboard mode, and Closed Caption compatibility.

Japan is at it again with rapidly increasing adoption of 3D-compatible home theater hardware. According to blog Crunchgear, 57% of Blu-ray recorders and 23% of all 40-inch plus HDTVs sold in Japan last month were 3D ready. This is up from roughly 7% and 3% for each, respectively, in early fall 2010. Cheaper prices and the holiday season probably bumped up these numbers temporarily, but big numbers nonetheless.
