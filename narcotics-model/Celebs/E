Kim Kardashian: "Sometimes You Don't Want to Hear What Your Family Has to Say"
Wed., Mar. 21, 2012 9:57 PM PDT by BRUNA NESSIF


We definitely know that some of Kim Kardashian's closest loved ones had their reservations on her marriage with Kris Humphries (Hi, Khloé!).
So why didn't Kim listen to them?

Well, looky what we have here.
It seems like karma has hit the Survivor: One World set, as this season's "villain" was pulled from the show.
Yes, you read that right, Colton Cumbie is gone.
So what happened?

Heejun Han gave us the heads-up that he was planning to do something "crazy" tonight on American Idol and he didn't disappoint! Plus, he wasn't the only contestant to pull a surprise on the audience!
In addition to Heejun's risky performance, which included pretending to need a do-over before ripping off his tux jacket, Erika Van Pelt debuted a drastic new 'do during the show: Goodbye, blond locks! Hello, black pixie cut!
So what did Heejun and Erika have to say about their scene-stealing moments tonight when we caught up with them after the show? And what did their fellow contestants think of their choices? Plus, what did Phillip Phillips really think of Diddy's comments?

Pass the Kleenex, One Tree Hill fans. Tonight's episode was a doozy.
We can't say much more about "Danny Boy" without completing spoiling what happened, so why don't we just tell you that we have an exclusive Q&A with the star of tonight's episode? Those who have yet to watch One Tree Hill, do not continue reading! We repeat, huge spoilers ahead! The rest of you, let's get real...

American Idol Top 10 Take On Billy Joel: Who's in Trouble? And What Was Heejun Thinking?!
Wed., Mar. 21, 2012 8:00 PM PDT by NATALIE FINN


More from Watch with Kristin
Billy Joel is a master musician and songwriter, no question, but he's actually very underrated as a singer.
We were reminded just how epic his talent is as we listened to the American Idol top 10 take on the famed New Yorker's songbook. Most of them did perfectly "OK," as Randy Jackson would say, but hardly any managed to tell a story the way Joel does.
Really, though, who could expect them to? But there were a few exceptions...

Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome: Why'd That Awesome Viral Trailer Get Yanked Off YouTube?
Wed., Mar. 21, 2012 7:23 PM PDT by BRUNA NESSIF


Yes, we know. You're very fracking annoyed right now.
An action-packed trailer for the avidly nerd-awaited Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome was screened at WonderCon this past weekend, then quickly went viral on YouTube, but just as fans were getting stoked to watch the planned prequel, the clip was yanked from YouTube.
Now, more bad news...

Ooh, it's a comedy-host showdown!
While doing his usual thing—you know, showing clips of Wendy Williams saying how she thinks Russell Brand smells like onions and old urine and Barbara Walters talking about ejaculation—Joel McHale got ambushed by two other guys that are used to crackin' some jokes.
At his expense, anyway.

Bent Premiere: Save It or Sink It?

Here's hoping Amanda Peet and David Walton won't be Bent out of shape by their new show's ratings come tomorrow morning! (Our worst Save It or Sink It opening line yet? Discuss!)
The duo's new romantic comedy Bent made its debut on NBC tonight and we're curious to know if the single-mom-meets-laidback-contractor story charmed viewers as much as it charmed us. Seriously, a romantic comedy that features Friday Night Lights and Arrested Development alums is basically what we dream about every night.
So what did you think of NBC's Bent?

Katy Perry's "Part of Me" Music Video Not What We Expected...but Still Rocks
Wed., Mar. 21, 2012 5:18 PM PDT by BRUNA NESSIF


Don't get us wrong, Katy Perry's "Part of Me" music video was jam-packed with girl power, and also, camouflage.
It all starts with Perry sitting in her car, watching her main squeeze flirt with another at work (we think). With her cute picture locket in hand, Perry rushes in and confronts her soon-to-be ex beau, who totally denies anything scandalous going on (right, buddy).
Cue Katy storming out and stopping at the gas station.

Adam Levine Sports a New Buzz Cut—Do You Like?
Wed., Mar. 21, 2012 5:00 PM PDT by BRUNA NESSIF

 
True / Splash News
Where did all the perfectly gelled hair go?!
It seems like Adam Levine has followed in the footsteps of many other Hollywood greats (like Charlie Sheen, Stephen Colbert, Zac Efron and, of course Robert Pattinson) by sporting a new 'do—the buzz cut.
But why?
