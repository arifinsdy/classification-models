Can they do that? Well, you really don't know if someone is listening. And, YES they can do that. The technology is available to intercept digital as well as cellular signals. But imagine if you had the ideal device that could assure your security and privacy. Would you buy it? Yes you would!  Well, imagine no further because it is available now in the form of ENIGMA E2 from Tripleton. Enigma E2, “Crypto” calls are 100 percent secure and are safe from in-network and ‘man in the middle’ attacks, as the security is independent of the network by using a secondary SIM card that holds unique codes and highly secure keys that two Enigma handsets use to authenticate each other to set p an encrypted call. The Enigma E2 handset itself offers such feature as a 2.4-inch colour display, GSM tri-band 900/1800/1900Mhz, GPRS, a 3 megapixel camera, FM radio, SMS text messaging, with encrypted messaging coming soon, Bluetooth for non-crypto calls, 1024bit RSA encryption for key exchange and 256bit AES encryption for voice, with random number generator, MS messaging with encrypted MMS coming soon, 2GB microSD card supplied, microSD expansion up to 32GB, and USB charging. Secure smartphones are nothing new in today's market but they are very expensive. More companies are getting into the market. Even BOEING (Jet Plane maker)  has announced development of a secure smartphone based on Google’s Android operating system. The company didn’t mention a target price for the Boeing Phone, but made it clear it would undercut the pricing on current solutions while still being too expensive for mainstream consumers. Boeing believes that by using Android with a series of security modifications, it can build a device much cheaper. Phones from the competition often run on proprietary software and require expensive back end systems. by TVLynx Labels: WORLDS MOST SECURE MOBILE PHONE ENIGMA E2 BY TRIPLETON Older Posts Home Subscribe to: Posts (Atom) TV-GUIDE (EST - SCHEDULE)  Subscribe To TVLynx Pageviews Loading...
