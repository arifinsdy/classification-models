Kardashian's and Sears
Well, I heard about the new line of fashion with The Kardashian's and Sears and I went online to see what type of clothing they had to offer. Not bad at all. The prices are reasonable and I loved the leggings and decided to buy a pair. Guess what? I ordered 1 pair and then it said to pick color and size and it didn't allow me to. Hmm, I guess they were out of stock. I just wish that if you are promoting merchandise and something is out of stock, then say so. Otherwise, the site is lovely and the prices are okay. I will be checking the site regularly to see if the item comes back in stock. Wish me luck. Oh, Hey Kardashian's bring in your merchandise! some items are out of stock. Hello!!!! :)
