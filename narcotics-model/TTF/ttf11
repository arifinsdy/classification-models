6 Zombie Mall
With the necessary skills to fend off the zombie menace still absent from most school curricula, it’s time to take matters into your own hands and make sure your loved ones know how best to handle the undead. Taking place at an abandoned, soon to be demolished shopping center near London in the UK, the Zombie Shopping Mall Experience is a £119 ($189) masterclass in being chased by brain-hungry hoards and keeping them at bay, albeit with airsoft guns and movie-grade special effects.

8 Zombie Sleep Mask
Do remember that scene from Shaun of the Dead? No, not the one where he takes that shortcut over the fence. (LOL)

The scene where they have to make it across the zombie infested street by acting like zombies. That one.

They may have had the acting like a zombie thing going for them but they sure as hell didn't look much like the dead. Zombies may be dumb, but they aren't that dumb to overlook a fresh British meal.

If ever faced with that situation again, might I suggest using the zombie sleep mask.

9 Tat-Tuesday: Rick Grimes
Another Tuesday, another day to share some zombie ink with you. Could Tuesdays possibly get any better?

This week we are gonna mix it up a bit here and instead of sharing a zombie tattoo I'm gonna share with you a little Walking Dead Ink. At least I'm keeping it zombie themed.
