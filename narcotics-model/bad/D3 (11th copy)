    Weed Pizza! I did it! (4 trys)

        Any good pizzeria will have an oven that goes to like 750, that's way too hot and will burn the THC. So I tried a few times and the 4th was the charm.

        Make your pizza like you normally would. Nothing different. About 5 minutes before she's done, remove the pizza from the oven (drop it to 325ish) then srpinkle your ground up bud over the cheese (first allow it to cool a minute or so) then put some more cheese on top of the bud. Place back in the oven and wait 20 minutes.

        Why 325? More heat will burn the THC and the pizza. 325 is the perfect heat that will get the top layer of cheese to melt and adhere to the THC, also it's not enough to burn your bread.

        If the pizza is done and you try this, the bread will be burnt. You need to know how to make a pizza first, then when you know you're about 5 minutes away, you drop the heat and add more weed and cheese.

        So far I've made 7 pizzas. Three sucked and didn't work, I wasted my weed. The last four worked quite well.

        Last time, I placed weed in certain parts of the pizza, then covered them with peporoni, that worked very well because when you bake peporoni it oozes oil. Took a little longer to work, and wasn't as good a high as just cheese (I think the cheese works better because more fat).

        If I could learn to make good oil, I could master the pizza.

        Still need a good name for the pizza.

        Tony's Pizza? No good.

        Perfect Pizza? Nah.

        Baked Pizza? Close but no cigar.

        Pot Pizza? Meh.

        Fuck Yeah Pizza? eww.

        Ganja Pizza? Closer.

        I want to perfect my pizza so the next family dinner wont be so boring.

        well theoreticly you could, tho you'd have to coat it in another layer of cheese, but i don't think any pizza lover has a problem with that...

        Tomorrow i'm havin a pizza [say, exactly 15inch] and im putting 4 grams into it. Should be fun. It's sunday, i might as well enjoy myself. I might even let me mate have some, concidering he's payin [payin for the pizza]

        I love the taste of weed, especially with cheese. That's my fave way to cook with it. Unless im cooking with hash oil, then i like to make a heavy cake kind of brick thing. Gets ya fucked though. Hash oil is seriously mind blowing stuf to cook with./

        I wish I still worked at dominoes...use to have a manager that smoked bud in the freezer (it cycled the air out so you couldn't smell it later on). she probably would have been totally cool to try this at the end of the night

        And I was laughing at the guy asking about doing this with a frozen pizza...i was thinking the same thing lol
