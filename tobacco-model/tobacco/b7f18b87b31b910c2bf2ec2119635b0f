base of  the year for which the most recent data are available from the federal trade commission ocr for page  page  american teenagers smoke regularly and  million people who regularly use smokeless tobacco are under age  three trends have caused a growing number of public health professionals to call attention to the role of marketing advertising and other promotional approaches in making tobacco use attractive to children and youths and in encouraging them to use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco first boys and girls are beginning to use tobacco at ever younger ages the average age at which boys and girls initiate smoking has declined over the past  decades by  years overall for whites  years overall for african americans and  and  years for white girls and africanamerican girls respectively the trend for girls to begin smoking at an earlier age began between  and  and the likelihood of becoming a daily smoker at an earlier age increased sharply in the early to mids both for boys and girls during the same period a second alarming trend in tobacco use has been noted more and more youths began using smokeless tobacco products half of the nations  million smokeless tobacco users are under the age of  and several national surveys show an increase in prevalence especially among boys a third trend which has occurred over the past  years entails a slowing down of the rate at which smoking prevalence by youths had been decreasing between  and  daily smoking among high school seniors dropped a total of about  from  to  an average of  percentage points per year yet during the following  years  to  during which time the tobacco industry more than doubled its advertising and promotion expenditures smoking by high school seniors fell by only a total of about  to  or only  percentage points per year among college students from  to  the decrease in daily smoking was about the same as for high school seniors except that for  there was a slight upward trend in prevalence of cigarette use notably during this same period  the per capita cigarette consumption fell  among adults what factors have contributed to stable smoking rates and to increased rates of smokeless tobacco use among children and youths but have proven to be less effective in sustaining tobacco use by adults public health advocates suggest that youths have a heightened sensitivity to image advertising and promotion themes at a time in their lives when they are struggling to define their own identities adolescence is characterized by three major types of developmental challenges a physical maturation b cultural pressures to begin the transition to adult roles and emotional independence from parents and c establishment of a coherent selfconcept and values cigarette advertisements are often evocative and play off these challenges in addition to being positioned to appeal to specific groups defined by social class and ethnic identity early adolescence ages  in particular may be a time of increased susceptibility to the appeal of image advertising and promotions the possible effects of marketing techniques on youths are considered below following a brief review of shifting trends in the appropriation of tobacco marketing dollars ocr for page  page  shifting trends in tobacco marketing tobacco advertising and promotions are clearly on the rise in the united states in  expenditures  billion on advertising and promotion of tobacco products were almost four times the amount  billion invested in  figure  from  to  alone expenditures increased  the current annual expenditures amount to  for every man woman and child in the united states promotional activities take many forms and are the fastest growing mode of product marketing they have been found to be effective in leading consumers to act once exposed to advertising the tobacco industrys distribution of marketing expenditures over the past  decades represents a major shift in marketing trends overall the ratio of promotional expenditures to advertising expenditures has reversed whereas in figure  source federal trade commission report to congress for  pursuant to the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act washington dc federal trade commission  ocr for page  page   advertisements represented  of total spending on tobacco marketing they were down to  in   in  and  in  although advertising expenditures per se have decreased overall spending on marketing advertising plus promotional activities has increased of the  billion spent annually on tobacco marketing about  million is spent on advertising the remaining  billion is spent on a variety of promotional activities designed to a place cigarettes and chewing tobacco in the hands of prospective users b position cigarettes and chewing tobacco in prominent locations in shops and other points of sale where they will be psychologically appealing and physically available to customers and c create good will for the tobacco industry among the public community leaders and politicians promoting tobacco use to consumers the goal of marketing is to increase the appeal and acceptability of a product as well as to make the product available to the potential consumer tobacco marketing strategies a establish attitudinal predispositions that lead nonusers to experiment with tobacco products and interpret their experience as positive and rewarding b foster the perception that consumption of tobacco products in general and in particular contexts places times is normative c minimize concern about the potential risks associated with tobacco use propagating the perception that there are safe smoking options and d reassure smokers and users of smokeless tobacco that possible risks are worth the benefits received from tobacco use marketing strategies promote both brandspecific and aggregate tobacco use the impression that tobacco use is desirable and normative is conveyed through image advertising and promotions that make tobacco products highly visible in public spacesif not by their presence then by proxy in the forms of brand trademarks insignia logos and items associated with preestablished brand images for example adventure scenarios the major forms of marketing are highlighted below  retail valueadded promotions and specialty items dramatically on the rise are retail valueadded promotions such as multiple packs buy one get one free centsoff coupons and a free key chain or lighter blisterpacked to a cigarette pack valueadded promotions and coupons constituted the largest marketing expenditure  of total marketing expenditures by the tobacco industry in  promotional items have special appeal to youths since youths have less disposable income and are more pricesensitive than adults promotions such as discount buyonegetonefree schemes may be especially attractive to them coupons are easily accessible to youths through directmail promotions see figure

commission  ocr for page  page  attractive specialty itemssuch as tshirts caps calendars and sporting goodsare distributed by the tobacco industry through the mail and at promotional events these items which sport a logo or brand name become walking advertisements capable of penetrating areas of a childs world that might be offlimits to other forms of advertising the ubiquity of such speciality items conveys the impression that tobacco use is the norm spending for specialty items accounted for  of expenditures in  a  gallup survey found that half of all adolescent smokers and onequarter of adolescent nonsmokers owned at least one promotional item from a tobacco company similar data were reported in a survey of almost  ninth graders in erie county new york  of regular smokers  of occasional smokers and  of nonsmokers reported owning clothing with a cigarette brand logo although most youths seem to find logo clothing appealing some high school students in focus groups conducted under the auspices of the committee found them tacky and would not consider wearing them notably however these same teens save marlboro miles and camel cash coupons in order to acquire other types of goods in a  survey of  respondents ages  ownership of an average of  tobacco promotional items was reported by  of the sample while  of current smokers reported participating in promotional campaigns  of nonsmoking teens were also active participants these promotional items carry no warning labels and provide free advertising my brother gets the camel cash hes got stacks and stacks of them to get hats or whatever  adolescent in focus group  promotional allowances constitute the second largest tobacco marketing expenditure of all marketingrelated expenditures through this form of promotion tobacco companies pay retailers for shelf space engage in cooperative advertising with retailers and offer trade promotions to wholesalers etc retailers are rewarded for stocking a wide variety of brands even brands with low market demand for example a convenience store owner who sells  packs per week may be motivated to stock over  different brand packings some having only  market share in order to be eligible to receive incentive payments which might be as high as  per year for a moderatesize retailer as a result of trade incentives cigarettes and other tobacco products are displayed prominently where adults as well as youths of all ages can see them selfservice displays are an important source of tobacco products for minors cigarettes are commonly displayed near checkout counters and flavored chewing tobacco has been reported to be displayed near candy racks in convenience shops a survey in california of stores near high schools found chewing tobacco next to candy and snacks in  of the stores in addition to catching the eye of a potential buyer who may not consciously be in the market for a tobacco ocr for page  page  product the positioning of tobacco with other commodities conveys subtle associational meanings for example when placed near liquor as they often are cigarettes come to be associated with adult status as well as with products promoted to shift ones consciousness away from the stress strains anxieties and boredom of routine existence as a means of providing some temporary release and relief  pointofsale advertising showcases particular brands of cigarettes in shops to stimulate impulse purchases since the  ban on broadcast advertising tobacco companies have made marketing through distribution a major function of their sales forces which numbered more than  industry wide in the early s this marketing technique places the tobacco products in convenient visible racks usually selfservice and in pointofpurchase displays pointofsale promotions tend to involve the retailer as well as the consumer in a brand product support of brands through pointofsale advertising helps to bolster the legitimacy of a brand in the eyes of retailers who make stocking decisions pointofsale materials are coordinated with national advertising campaigns to tie retailers in with the imagebuilding for the product in this sense pointofsale advertising both influences product distribution and directly induces consumption pointofsale advertising in retail establishments has been increasing and in  represented  of advertising and promotional expenditures  magazine and newspaper advertising accounted for about  of marketing expenditures in  when expenditures on newspaper ads reached an alltime low of  a large drop since the  high of  magazine ads were down to  of marketing dollars in  from  in  nevertheless expenditures on tobacco advertising in the print media do continue to be substantial and the decreases are not occurring at the same rate across all market segments for example while the number of ads per magazine issue has declined in mens and womens magazines it has remained relatively stable in those magazines having substantial africanamerican and youth readerships in addition advertisements are often combined with interactive promotional items that appeal to children and youths for example many magazine advertisements feature giveaway noncigarette utility items calendars lighters tshirts and action products associated with cash coupon catalogue offers magazines often inform potential customers to be on the lookout for additional information about these offers at pointofsale locations they advertise a lot every magazine i havetheres an ad for camels marlboros newports high school girl in focus group ocr for page  page   the tobacco industry was the number one spender for outdoor advertising in  of the approximately  million billboards in the united states  were allocated to tobacco and alcohol products advertising through the use of outdoor billboards and transit system signs accounted for  of all tobacco marketing expenditures in  the industry has saturated africanamerican neighborhoods with cigarette billboards studies reveal that the intensity of cigarette billboard advertising is  times greater in africanamerican than in white neighborhoods in columbia south carolina and  times greater in baltimore despite supposed industry standards to the contrary billboards advertising tobacco products can be found next to homes schools churches parks playgrounds health centers stadiums shopping centers and along rural and city streets more permanent than magazine advertising and seen over and over again by youths billboard ads expose children repeatedly to protobacco messages and give the erroneous impression that smoking is pervasive and normative  sponsorship of sporting events and public entertainment associates tobacco with a allamerican cultural events such as music concerts and art exhibits where fundamental social values are celebrated and b highrisk sporting events such as rodeos and car racing where risks are socially approved and taken by individuals who brave the odds the tobacco industry sponsors opera and ballet performances and concerts of rock rap country and western blues jazz and classical music making tobacco products highly visible to diverse populations and strengthening the association between cigarettes artistic expression entertainment glamour and individuality expenditures on the promotion of sports and sporting events are growing the  surgeon generals report has called special attention to sponsorship of sporting events associated with a companys brand name andor logo noting that this constitutes one of the most effective means of covert advertising even during events that are not sponsored by the tobacco industry tobacco products are permanently displayed tobacco billboards are the dominant form of advertisement in many major professional stadiums youths attend such sporting events and watch them on television many seek to emulate sports superstars such as baseball players who visibly chew and spit tobacco during these sports events thereby actually demonstrating the use of the products on the billboards each second exposure of a billboard in a ballpark has a marketing impact similar to a second tv commerciala widely cited example of just how much product exposure is realized through covert advertising during sporting events is the  marlboro grand prix when the event was televised the marlboro logo could be seen for  of the  total minutes of this sport events broadcast time in the  nascar stock race circuit the winston logo appeared for a total of  hours and  minutesnonpaid covert advertising on the air valued at  million in   motorsports broadcasts were quantitatively measured for estimates of product exposure value the programs had a ocr for page  page  total viewing audience of  million  of whom were children and teens and an overall tobacco product exposure value of  million  million for winston  million for marlboro  million for skoal  million for camel and  million for others studies have found that youths accurately associate sporting events with tobacco brands  distribution of free samples of cigarettes in public places for adults only was at its highest percentage about  of total marketing dollars in the early s and has stayed about  since the late s monitoring of who is given free samples has been poor and tobacco companies who contractout sample distribution have taken no responsibility for cited violations in which minors have been given samples  expenditures for directmail promotions are on the rise  million was spent in  an increase of  over  all five major cigarette companies actively compile mailing lists of customers largely from coupons which ask for name address usual brand etc from promotion redemptions from the return of smoker surveys in magazines and from the return of more general consumer information questionnaires the forms sometimes ask detailed questions about brand use and about demographic characteristics brown  williamson lorrilard and american brands use their lists occasionally to send out coupons r j reynolds tobacco company rjr philip morris tobacco company and united states tobacco company ust have made more substantial use of their mailing lists ust sends its listees a slick quarterly magazine heartland which puts skoal and copenhagen in a pleasant context and contains various offers rjr and philip morris mount regular mailings promoting a variety of brands depending on the characteristics of the persons on the lists rjr promotes camel and discount brands and sometimes sends out coupons good for any topoftheline rjr cigarette product philip morris has distinct mail programs for marlboro virginia slims merit and benson  hedges individuals on the camel lists have received at least six mailings in the past year apart from any coupon redemptions these directmail efforts are large undertakings philip morris in a letter to its retailers dated july   indicated that it had  million people on its mailing lists while a large number of teenagers may be included on these mailing lists the tobacco companies has no mechanism for purging minors from their lists slade and colleagues conducted a nationally representative randomdigit dial survey of  respondents aged  to  to assess participation in promotional activities they found that  of the sample had received mail from a tobacco company extrapolating this figure to the entire  to yearold population they estimate that  million teens are on tobacco industry mailing lists direct mail may be a form of promotion that tobacco companies will pursue ocr for page  page  more aggressively if restrictions on conventional advertising are adopted the expenditure data show a continuing trend toward advertising and promotional practices that are not required to carry health warnings inhibiting opposition to tobacco use the tobacco industrys spending on advertising inhibits dissemination of antitobacco messages billboard companies allegedly have expressed reluctance to rent space for antismoking ads because they are well paid to saturate africanamerican neighborhoods with smoking ads and believe that they cannot afford to lose tobacco conglomerate accounts magazines that receive sizable revenues for advertising tobacco are less likely to run articles that discuss the negative aspects of tobacco use than magazines not dependent on tobacco industry revenue when articles are run that could potentially shed a negative light on tobacco use they are toned down through editing this practice termed latent censorship gives the public a distorted view of the dangers of smoking for example during the first  years after cigarette ads were banned on television in  the only two magazines readers digest and the new yorker that carried accurate articles on the link between tobacco and disease refused to accept cigarette ads a study of tobacco advertising in  magazines between  through  and  through  noted and confirmed a tendency toward latent censorship in womens magazines regarding the health effects of smoking as a result of their large amount of advertising income magazines that did not carry advertisements for cigarettes were more than  more likely to cover the hazards of smoking than were magazines that carried cigarette advertisements    womens magazines that did not carry cigarette advertisements were  times more likely to cover the risks of smoking magazines for african americans have earned revenues from tobacco ads since at least  a study of patterns of tobacco advertising in magazines from  to  found that african americans were at first subject to less then to more advertising than whites the greatest concentration of tobacco company advertising is in africanamerican publications such as jet essence and ebony but many small local publications and other media serving the africanamerican community have found it extremely difficult to find other means of financial support and might not survive without tobacco advertisements a similar effect of latent censorship results when revenue for advertising comes from one of the numerous companies that belong to tobacco industry conglomerates for example nabisco general foods kraft in  after the ad agency saatchi and saatchi prepared ads touting the nosmoking policy of its client northwest airlines rjrnabisco cancelled an  million annual contract with that agency for advertising food products a study of advertising executives found that they do fear economic reprisals from tobacco conglomerates should they print articles unfavorable to the tobacco industry ocr for page  page  the tobacco market and market segmentation tobacco has been aggressively marketed to the american public through a number of different channels and interactive modalities in order to foster demand for particular brands of tobacco products create a more permissive environment in which to engage in tobacco use and establish tobacco use as a norm of acceptable social behavior if not a habit to be emulated ever sensitive to social and cultural differences the tobacco industry has gone to great pains to position tobacco products through market segmentation tobacco products are marketed to appeal to specific market niches to existing smokers as well as potential smokers tobacco a mature and a growth market the tobacco industry claims that its primary if not sole purposes for advertising and promoting tobacco products are to a provide information to tobacco consumers regarding product choice b capture brand share from competitors and c maintain product loyalty in a mature market identifying a market as mature bears close examination for what the term both reveals and conceals some but not all products are categorized by marketing experts as constituting either a mature or growth market in mature markets awareness of a product is nearly universal and demand is relatively stable most of the market segment is already using the product rises in product use are not dramatic and expansion results from getting consumers to use a product more often or in new ways in growth markets new market segments are identified new users are a source of significant market expansion and rises in product use are significant the cigarette market simultaneously displays characteristics of being both a mature and a growth market the industry calls attention to the fact that cigarette sales have been fairly consistent over the last decade however it is clear that per capita consumption has decreased and that the tobacco industry loses  million smokers a yearthose who quit and those who die about  million and  million respectively since  consequently market expansion must be occurring to maintain total tobacco sales at a consistent level adults are not a likely population for that market expansion because few new smokers are adults furthermore for three decades the trend among adults has been to quit smoking in fact most new smokers are youths  of daily smokers are daily smokers by age  market segmentation to reach youths considerable research on the part of the tobacco industry has resulted in the positioning of specific brands in different market segments this entails vigilant ocr for page  page  that advertising and promotion causally affect the decisions of young people to begin smoking many of the participants in this ongoing debate seem to assume that a definitive finding of causality is a necessary predicate for legislative action restricting tobacco promotion and advertising in the committees view however requiring definitive proof of causality on issues of this nature would unjustifiably stymie sensible public health regulation indeed the history of public health successes from vaccination to cholera prevention and injury control suggest that detailed causal understanding is apt to follow an intervention rather than be a precondition for it if youth smoking fell after advertising and promotion were eliminated this would corroborate a hypothesis for which there is already ample suggestive evidencethat such advertising and promotion is an important factor in the initiation of tobacco use by youths this seems to be the lesson from the experiences reviewed in the new zealand report the inability to conduct case control studies in an environment free of tobacco marketing makes it impossible to discern the independent causal effect of advertising and promotion on tobacco consumption it is difficult to disentangle the actual impact of marketing expenditures from the other social and cultural factors that affect tobacco use moreover the influence of any of these environmental variables is mediated by and interacts with so many other variables affecting perceptions of and attitudes toward tobacco use that any statistical association between levels of promotional expenditures and levels of tobacco use is difficult to interpret this is not to say that the relationship is not a causal one only that any causal effect is inevitably obscured by layers of other factors and that it is virtually impossible to quantify the causal effect in any definitive way indeed when one takes into account the inherent difficulty of discerning a causal influence the substantial convergent evidence that advertising and promotion increases tobacco use by youths is impressive and in the committees view provides a strong basis for legal regulation having said this the committee does not think that the argument for restricting the advertising and promotion of tobacco products must rest on a definitive or unequivocal finding that such activities causally influence levels of consumption it is enough that the advertising and promotional activities described above in this chapter have the natural tendency to encourage initiation and maintenance of smoking by children and adolescents there can be no doubt that the tobacco companies aim to portray smoking in a favorable light and to communicate messages that link use of tobacco products to positive feelings images and experiences even if the primary objective of those marketing expenditures is to preserve or expand market share among existing smokers youngsters are routinely exposed to messages that encourage them to smoke tobacco advertising is characterized by images and themes that are especially appealing to adolescents and some are appealing to children in addition a large proportion of promotional expenditures associate use of tobacco with ocr for page  page  activities and products that are attractive to children and youths the sheer amount of expenditures for advertising and promotion assures that young people will be exposed to these messages on a massive scale it is clear that societys efforts to discourage young people from smoking are obstructedand perhaps fatally underminedby the industrys efforts to portray their dangerous products in a positive light in sum portraying a deadly addiction as a healthful and sensual experience tugs against the nations efforts to promote a tobaccofree norm and to discourage tobacco use by children and youths this warrants legislation restricting the features of advertising and promotion that make tobacco use attractive to youths the question is not are advertising and promotion the causes of youth initiation but rather does the preponderance of evidence suggest that features of advertising and promotion tend to encourage youths to smoke the answer is yes and this is a sufficient basis for action even in the absence of a precise and definitive causal chain recommendations policy recommendations the images typically associated with advertising and promotion convey the message that tobacco use is a desirable socially approved safe and healthful and widely practiced behavior among young adults whom children and youths want to emulate as a result tobacco advertising and promotion undoubtedly contribute to the multiple and convergent psychosocial influences that lead children and youths to begin using these products and to become addicted to them as already noted the committee believes that american society through all organized social institutions should take aggressive measures to discourage the use of tobacco products by children and youths the message should be unequivocaltobacco use is unhealthy and socially disapproved in the context of this emergent social norm the contradictory messages now conveyed by the tobacco industry can no longer be tolerated the committee therefore recommends a stepbystep plan to eliminate these commercial messages from the various media of mass communication realizing that implementation of this recommendation will require careful planning and a period of transition the committee proposes a sequential process for phasing in the necessary restrictions first congress should repeal the federal law preempting state regulation of tobacco promotion and advertising that occurs entirely within the states borders this should be accomplished by the end of  the repeal will have the effect of stimulating local interest in tobacco regulation and community participation in reviewing tobacco data and in drafting legislation aimed ocr for page  page  at promotion distribution and use of tobacco products concordant with federal guidelines a wide range of national experiments will take place providing data on the effect of various programs state and local regulation of cigarette advertising to a large extent has been foreclosed by federal law which expressly prohibits states and localities from imposing any requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health    with respect to the advertising and promotion of any cigarettes that meet federal labeling requirements to the extent that state and local regulation of tobacco advertising or promotion aims to promote public health objectives it is curtailed by this sweeping federal preemption it can be argued however that state and local governments retain the authority to ban advertising likely to reach a large audience of children because such action aims mainly to minimize violations of laws against youth access and is therefore not based on smoking and health relying on this argument transportation systems in the cities of boston denver portland new york seattle and san francisco and in the state of utah have eliminated tobacco advertising on their vehicles whether those actions are lawful remains unclear the communication and tobacco industries have legitimate interests in avoiding diverse and often incompatible statebystate regulation of advertising and promotional activities occurring in national media however state and local governments should be free to circumscribe advertising and promotion that occur exclusively within the geographic boundaries of a single state in order to protect and promote the health and welfare of its citizens subject only to the command of the first amendment therefore congress should modify the preemption provision so that the states have clear authority to restrict or ban advertising and promotion at the point of sale on public transportation systems and vehicles on billboards in public arenas or sports facilities or other locations located entirely within a states boundaries second after state regulatory authority has been clarified and restored states and localities should severely restrict the advertising and promotion of tobacco products on billboards and other outdoor media on vehicles in facilities of public transportation in public arenas and sports facilities and at the point of sale states and localities should either ban tobacco advertising and promotion altogether or should restrict such messages to a tombstone format tombstone advertising would limit commercial messages to information about the product and would forbid the use of images and pictures this approach is designed to eliminate all the images that imply that tobacco use is beneficial and make it attractive and that encourage young people to use tobacco products the most common concept of tombstone advertising would allow only text in an advertisement a broader concept of tombstone advertising would permit the use of slogans scenes or colors in tobacco advertisements or on tobacco packaging specific decisions regarding the type of information that would be permitted should be made by a regulatory authority ocr for page  page  third congress should enact comprehensive legislation establishing a timetable for gradual implementation of a plan for restricting tobacco advertising and promotion in interstate commerce essential components of this plan which should be enacted by the end of  and should become fully effective by the year  include a restricting to a tombstone format the advertising of tobacco products in print media including magazines and newspapers or in other visual media including videotape videodisc video arcade game or film b banning the commercial use of the registered brand name of a tobacco product trademark or logo or other recognizable symbol for such a product in any movie music video television show play video arcade game or other form of entertainment or on any other product and c banning the use of the registered brand name of a tobacco product a trademark or logo or other recognizable symbol for such a product in any public place or in any medium of mass communication for the purpose of publicizing revealing or documenting sponsorship of or contribution to any athletic artistic or other public event these proposals represent essential components of the regulatory plan by recommending these steps the committee does not mean to exclude other restrictions or to disapprove more restrictive steps such as banning advertising altogether the committee has endorsed the tombstone format because this approach is necessary to eliminate those features of advertising that tend to encourage tobacco use by children and youths no less restrictive approach would accomplish the legislative objective the committee is confident that state and federal legislation implementing these recommendations will substantially further the nations compelling interest in preventing tobacco use by children and youths and that such legislation would survive constitutional challenges brought by the affected media or by the tobacco industry research recommendations the committee recommends research should be conducted that attends to ethnic gender and social class differences that is sensitive to youths responses to advertising and promotional messages and that assesses the success as well as the failure of advertising campaigns the research question to date has primarily been what does advertising do to people research should now ask what do people do with advertising and counteradvertising as a result of the types of research methods used and the research questions asked much of the literature on tobacco use and advertising attributes little agency to the public in general and to youths in particular the public is consid ocr for page  page  ered to be rather passive and easily manipulated while there is some truth to this view it hardly expresses a complete picture of this complex interactive phenomenon required are longitudinal and ethnographic accounts of tobacco use that are responsive to local context studies that are notably absent in the smoking literature in need of consideration are the ways in which a advertising provides resources images for teen subgroup identity construction and social statement b advertising is responsive to existing and emergent social uses of smoking among various subgroups c tobacco use takes on meaning in response to antitobaccouse messages generated by the tobacco industry as well as by public health advocates that is messages that are moralistic or focus
