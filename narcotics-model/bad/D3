    Marijuana Quotes

        here's a few:

        “i talked to Snoop doggy dogg today. well I'm not sure if you could realy call it talked because I could hardly understand what he was saying. But i think he was trying to communicate was that he wanted to work with me in some sort of capacity and something involving marijuana.” -Marilyn Manson

        "I now have absolute proof that smoking even one marijuana cigarette is equal in brain damage to being on Bikini Island during an H-bomb blast.” -Ronald Reagan

        “Even if one takes every reefer madness allegation of the prohibitionists at face value, marijuana prohibition has done far more harm to far more people than marijuana ever could.” -William F. Buckley, Jr.

        “Whenever the people are for gay marriage or medical marijuana or assisted suicide, suddenly the "will of the people" goes out the window.” -Bill Maher

        “Marijuana is the finest anti-nausea medication known to science, and our leaders have lied about this consistently. [Arresting people for] medical marijuana is the most hideous example of government interference in the private lives of individuals. It's an outrage within an outrage within an outrage.” -Peter McWilliams

        Some quotes from Harry J. Anslinger, who pretty much convinced Congress to outlaw marijuana and without whom it would still probably be legal:

        “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others.”

        “...the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.”

        “Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.”

        “Reefer makes darkies think they're as good as white men.”

        “Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing.” (so they become pacifist murderers?)

        “You smoke a joint and you're likely to kill your brother.”

        “Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.”

        “Marihuana makes fiends of boys in thirty days – Hashish goads users to bloodlust.”

        “By the tons it is coming into this country – the deadly, dreadful poison that racks and tears not only the body, but the very heart and soul of every human being who once becomes a slave to it in any of its cruel and devastating forms.... Marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum. Smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse of horrid specters. Hasheesh makes a murderer who kills for the love of killing out of the mildest mannered man who ever laughed at the idea that any habit could ever get him....”

        “Users of marijuana become STIMULATED as they inhale the drug and are LIKELY TO DO ANYTHING. Most crimes of violence in this section, especially in country districts are laid to users of that drug.”

        “Was it marijuana, the new Mexican drug, that nerved the murderous arm of Clara Phillips when she hammered out her victim's life in Los Angeles?... THREE-FOURTHS OF THE CRIMES of violence in this country today are committed by DOPE SLAVES – that is a matter of cold record.”

        "The question arises, therefore, why cannabis is so regularly banned in countries where alcohol is permitted. [...] It may be that we can ban cannabis simply because the people who use it, or would do so, carry little weight in social matters and are relatively easy to control, whereas the alcohol user often carries plenty of weight in social matters and is difficult to control, as the U.S. prohibition era showed. It has yet to be shown, however, that the one is more socially or personally disruptive than the other."
        Ph.D. H.B.M Murphy, M.D.
        Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal.
        "The Cannabis Habit" (1963)
        published in 'Bulletin on Narcotics'


        "Persons using this narcotic [marijuana] smoke the dried leaves of the plant, which has the effect of driving them completely insane. The addict loses all sense of moral responsibility. Addicts to this drug, while under its influence, are immune to pain, and could be injured without having any realization of their condition. While in this condition they become raving maniacs and are liable to kill or indulge in any form of violence to other persons, using the most savage methods of cruelty without, as said before, any sense of moral responsibility. . . . If this drug is indulged in to any great extent, it ends in the untimely death of its addict."

        Emily Murphy
        Edmonton Canada, 1923
        campaigner for cannabis prohibition in Canada

        "The very man who has argued you down,will sometimes be found,years later,to have been influenced by what you said" ~ C.S.Lewis

        It has always been my rule never to smoke when asleep, and never to refrain when awake. ~ Mark Twain

        That's my favorite one. And from a conservative no less.

        “One's condition on marijuana is always existential. One can feel the importance of each moment and how it is changing one. One feels one's being, one becomes aware of the enormous apparatus of nothingness -- the hum of a hi-fi set, the emptiness of a pointless interruption, one becomes aware of the war between each of us, how the nothingness in each of us seeks to attack the being of others, how our being in turn is attacked by the nothingness in others.” - Norman Mailer

    technically it's song lyrics but I'm givin some love to the lady tokers <3

        "You say you've never seen a lady love the herb like I do, true you say it's not a part of your culture for the lady to smoke the herb, I love my sensi, it makes me feel so irate*; for true meditation I need my brain food everyday, true iration* is where I must stay! I need you to understand why I need my pacalolo** strictly island vibes, all of my life. So many people die from alcohol each day, no one ever dies from gettin' irate*, cigarettes are bad that's what the doctors say, that's why I realize my love for sensi!" - Irie Love

        * she uses irate in a weird way, it's meant as an "intense version of irie" which means basically everything is great.

        **hawaiian for pot

    Smile May I add.....

        "Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth & protection of the country." -Thomas Jefferson (It still is!)

        "An acre of the best ground for hemp, is to be selected and sewn in hemp and be kept for a permanent hemp patch."

        Thomas Jefferson's Garden book- 1849

        I once read his Garden book- there were 3 references (that I remember) to hemp. There was the above, another referring to planting more hemp, and the third was him wistfully regretting that he would not be home for the hemp harvest! (Now, I know the slaves were familiar with smoking hemp- I wonder if "Brown Sallie" turned him on to it? )


        "May 12-13: Sowed Hemp at Muddy hole by Swamp. August 7: Began to separate the Male from the Female at Do - rather too late."
        George Washington - Diary


        "In defense of the Pygmies, perhaps I should note that a friend of mine who has spent time with them says that for such activities as the patient stalking and hunting of mammals and fish they prepare themselves through marijuana intoxication, which helps to make the long waits, boring to anyone further evolved than a Komodo dragon, at least moderately tolerable. Ganja is, he says, their only cultivated crop. It would be wryly interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led generally to the invention of agriculture, and thereby to civilization."
        Carl Sagan - The Dragons of Eden - 1977

        (And I have heard the Pygmies have the best ganja in Africa!)


        "Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes. A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very principles upon which our government was founded."
        Abraham Lincoln, - December 1840

        "The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this."
        Albert Einstein,
        "My First Impression of the USA," 1921

        Einstein, Sagan, Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson- none of them are exactly dumb-bunnies! Wish our politicians would read the quotes listed in this thread! - Granny 

        "If the truth won't do, then something is wrong!"
        Granny's Grandpa- Rev. J. C. Schwabenland

        If you substitute marijuana for tobacco and alcohol, you'll add eight to 24 years to your life.

        In fact, marijuana lowers your stress level and lowers your body temperature. It actually seems that people live longer if they use it.

        Well, as I understand it, the main supporters are beer companies and the pharmaceutical companies. I'd like them to show me the dead bodies from marijuana. But they can't because there aren't any.

        - Jack Herer

        Dogs are attracted to the smell of marijuana.
        -Kenneth Anger

        "Man made booze. God made marijuana. Who do you trust?"
        -Anonymous

        They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you're high, you can do everything you normally do, just as well. You just realize that it's not worth the f****** effort. There is a difference."
        -Bill Hicks

        "Smoking's a way to let you down slowly from a ballgame. It also makes you use less of the resources around. It makes people better in the way they act towards society. Everybody's nicer. It's hard to be mean when you're stoned."
