holes poked through it there are many different kind of bowls made from a variety of materials and in various styles please see our hookah bowls guide for more specific information some bowls can be quite beautiful and are made with unique food safe glazes for a unique aesthetic quality tangiers bowls are the most well known bowls that make use of these interesting styles hookah stem the stem is the main body of the hookah it is the pipe that the bowl sits on top of and through which the smoke travels before it reaches the vase and water this is also considered the main part of the hookah number of hoses a hookah can have a single hose port or multiple and this will changed the smoking experience i have seen hookahs with up to  hose ports i believe that a single hose port is all that you need and offers the best smoking experience there are two kinds of hose ports the traditional port is only a tube that leads into the vase when smoking from a multiple hose hookah with traditional hose ports you need to plug your hose when other hoses are being smoked from otherwise fresh air is drawn back into the vase and the smoke quality will be reduced an auto seal hose port is one that has a ball bearing valve so that air can only be drawn out of the vase and is not drawn back the valve is similar to the design of a purge valve auto seal ports are most often found on multiple hose hookahs this helps to eliminate the need to plug the hose when not smoking each port having an auto seal valve means that the hookah can not be purged for more information read the hookah hose guide hookah base the base of the hookah is also known as a vase and is made most commonly out of glass the original base of the first hookahs were made from coconuts glass bottles were used eventually and that is where hookah got its original name shisha means glass and also bottle there are also metal vases and the occasional clay vase a base can be any vessel that is food safe hold water and seals completely with the stem inserted into the mouth hookahs can come in a variety of shapes and designs there are different traditional shapes that vary from place to place syria sees many vases that are shallow and have a wide bottom egyptian vases are somewhat bell shaped and are the most common shape of hookah vase essential accessories charcoal tongs used to manipulate the hot charcoal without burning your fingers good tongs with good grip are important so that you dont drop coals resulting in fire or personal injury easily forgotten as one of the most necessary accessories extra hoses having extra hoses is a good idea so that you can rotate them between bowls to avoid flavors mixing in ways that you dont want allowing the previously used hose to air out and dry out also helps to preserve the hose its best to hang the hose up so that it dries evenly washable hoses can be cleaned between bowls to remove the previous flavor quickly and avoid ghosting but should still be dried so you have little droplets of water remaining in the hose when using traditional hoses its a good idea to have one hose for the different styles of flavor because they cant be cleaned cleaning kit a long thin bristled brush is used to clean the inside of the stem and remove the nasty gunk that builds up from the smoke and the dripping molasses a shorter and wider brush is used to scrub the inside of the vase a line of residue can build up at the water line on the glass and needs to be scrubbed to remove it some people use alcohol based cleaning solutions that have mildly abrasive additives to aid in the cleaning process its also a good idea to get some extra long pipe cleaners to clean the purge valve and the hose ports wind covers a wind cover is used to protect the coals from strong breezes and to help them not burn too fast a wind cover is actually used most effectively to intensify the heat on the bowl so that you can use less coal and fine tune your heat management hookah
