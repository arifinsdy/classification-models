I think there is nobody who did not imagine at least once an erotic fight between Street Fighter heroes Chun Li and Cammy. With the help of cosplay top model Mea Lee we set up this fight in one set for CosplayErotica. I hope you will like it, this was the last shooting for my Cammy outfit as we demolished it finally. Have a great weekend! Angela www.angelablanche.com 1 Comment Mood: Joy More Journal Entries deviantID ~angelablanche Angela Blanche Artist | Professional My name is Angela Blanche or simply "Angel". I had my first exposure to modeling and the beauty industry at 18 when my parents sent me to modeling school, and I soon started to get bookings. Since becoming a model, I have experienced a lot, met interesting people, and traveled widely. I have even worked as stunt double and acted in a few well-known movies. Through this, I have discovered much about my own strengths and weaknesses. I have a great deal of fun when I work in front of the camera and I'm still experiencing new and interesting things. I travel around the world with my photographer and we make erotic stories at interesting and exotic places. My goal is to bring more light into your life and bring back the beauty of classy erotica.
