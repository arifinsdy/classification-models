shortly to be an open market free of taxes does it go back that far you ask further it was charles ii that banned a commercial tobacco growing industry in the uk over  years ago im a grandad to twelve and dad to four that i declare they think im crazy spring sowing seeds and preparing the soil to plant out later summer tending the crop and reaping my harvest evening walks are to aimed at the flowers they are a thing of beauty there could be hundreds on each plant each ripened bud should produce  seed where could this bud end up leaf is suspended from anywhere i can find a space indoors outdoors under a lean to but the do dry im called out to help in a national play the cast need training to make cigars fun its brilliant fun better still the royal national let me have their props when it was over they can have them back next year the tobacco has gone through my curing chamber by november i have a vast amount of cured tobacco from past years the national had  kilos of this this is for my quiet hour when i will hand roll my cigars to put away for future years whilst the tobacco is still maturing i have tobacco from over ten years old it matures like wine mellow like me  am i crazy because if i am join me guys its not about money saving taxes beating the system its a hobby and now i have thousands of friends on the forum that have joined in the spirit of friendship sharing their experience good or bad success is not guaranteed many of the limited instructions i see on other sites questions if they have ever grown tobacco follow mine and you cant go wrong but to get them you need the seeds they may be free with each order but for me to offer a spam free forum for all to use it costs if you buy cheap seeds thinking you can cut corners on the instructions please dont ask our members to explain  pages you are missing what you need is in the  postings takes some looking for though you will see some heavy posters on the forum some bought seeds off me years ago yet still stick around to help others like yourself perhaps we are all crazy im chris gurney and many years ago i was in the position of looking for an interesting hobby and so i began growing my own tobacco my aim now is to give you the benefit of my knowledge so you could also smoke for free with no hidden catches new customers between  and  sharing our tobacco seeds with their friends makes current production too difficult to estimate after one year of following my detailed instructions most customers are experts these customers will be your guides in the future on our tobacco forums pictures of their crop can be seen on tobacco forums  a few hours on the forum could guarantee a crop of tobacco and unlike other sites our detailed instruction are free with every order tobacco seeds can be purchased from many sources but very few sell seeds that will produce more seeds for the following years crop mine will some tobacco seed retailers on the internet also insist on membership to their tobacco club or they only sell pelleted tobacco seeds see our tobacco newsletter for more information and this can be expensive over the years we do not require any form of membership fees from you this will be your site and it is hoped your shared experiences of tobacco growing on the tobacco forums will help other first time growers tobacco seeds are a long way from producing a smokeable product there is the growing drying curing and storing of the tobacco if you wish to produce a smokeable product from your tobacco seeds unlike some other tobacco seed retailers we provide detailed instructions with every order to help you succeed we also provide free online help to all our customers the instructions you will receive give detailed information on all aspects of growing to smoking and will describe the simple and cheap equipment required available from your local diy or hardware shop you will need to provide outdoor land to grow these plants and in most countries a garden will do if however you live in a cold and windy environment like the highlands of scotland then a pollytunnel would be recommended my seed packets with  varieties of tobacco seeds  of each variety   seeds could product  kilos of tobacco other packs of at least  seeds could produce  cigarettes or  kilos of cigarette  pipe  cigar leaf now you work out the cost of  cigarettes in your country  its no wonder the tobacco barons are so wealthy  a small point worth bearing in mind we provide packs of  tobacco seeds yet other tobacco seed retailers provide packs of only  or  tobacco seeds our bigger packs of tobacco seeds can give you even greater savings  does tobacco grow in the uk how many times this has been asked of me king charles  in the second half of the s banned a successful commercial tobacco growing industry to promote the american colonies what an idiot  pity he didnt give away the crown jewels instead see the history of smoking which comes with your order do i advocate smoking never of course it must affect your health a  a day smoker in the uk is paying upwards of  per week to the taxman and in some homes  of food on the table could benefit the whole familys health spend some time in our tobacco forums to find out the cost of smoking around the world its becoming a luxury in all countries this hobby takes you outdoors and will give you an interesting and rewarding pastime try it and find out for yourself the reaction to my bringing this old skill back to the public has been greatly publicised by local national and international press the bbc greater london radio gave me an opportunity to tell the public live without the support these newspapers and writers have given me many of the noncomputer age public would not be smoking their own tobacco today further coverage on bbc tv news and bbc radio  has created even more tobacco growers amongst the british public overseas publicity will always be welcome how about contacting your local press to draw their attention to this site all that remains is for me to wish you the best of luck with growing your own tobacco if you have any comments or questions or if you wish to tell us about your growing experiences please do so we would love to hear from you please feel free to post your comments or questions on our tobacco forums however please read through our forums before posting questions to see
