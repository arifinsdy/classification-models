Crochet Newborn Baby Hat

Baby hat finished. I've still got the mary jane booties to finish. I don't know why I always wait to the last minute to finish stuff.

I took these pictures at night, so I don't think they came out well, but I'm making a newborn baby hat and booties, for my younger cousin. She's having her first baby in July, so I wanted to make something for her, for her baby shower that's coming up. The hat is almost done, I've just got to work on the shoes. I'm kind of stuck on one point, but hopefully I'll figure it out all by the time of the baby shower, which is in a couple of weeks.
