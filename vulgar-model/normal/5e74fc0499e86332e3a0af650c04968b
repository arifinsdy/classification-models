IMPORTANT NOTICES: (1) You MUST put /home/uday/ns-allinone-2.27/otcl-1.8, /home/uday/ns-allinone-2.27/lib, into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. If it complains about X libraries, add path to your X libraries into LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If you are using csh, you can set it like: setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .... If you are using sh, you can set it like: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.... (2) You MUST put /home/uday/ns-allinone-2.27/tcl8.4.5/library into your TCL_LIBRARY environmental variable. Otherwise ns/nam will complain during startup. (3) [OPTIONAL] To save disk space, you can now delete directories tcl8.4.5 and tk8.4.5. They are now installed under /home/uday/ns-allinone-2.27/{bin,include,lib} so , finally the bash_profile is like this: PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/bin:/home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/tcl8.4.5/unix:/home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/tk8.4.5/unix export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/otcl-1.8:home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/lib export TCL_LIBRARY=/home/uday/ns2/ns-allinone-2.27/tcl8.4.5/library cd ns-2.27; ./validate same steps for other distro too..
