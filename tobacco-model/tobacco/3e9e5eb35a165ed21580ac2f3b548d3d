history of tobacco regulation own your ow legal marijuana business your guide to making money in the multibillion dollar marijuana industry major studies of drugs and drug policy marihuana a signal of misunderstanding  table of contents national commission on marihuana and drug abuse history of tobacco regulation this section is based in part on a paper prepared for the commission by jane langmcgrew an attorney from washington dc since  when john rolfe introduced a successful experiment in tobacco cultivationin virginia morison    the leaf has assumed major social industrial economicand medical implications consequently persons concerned with tobacco on a commercial orpersonal basis have been subject to a variety of different regulations over the past years tobacco has been attacked by social observers and medical authorities for the damage ithas allegedly done to the social and physical condition of man yet it has also provideda substantial source of revenue to the state and federal governments of the united states as is now the case with alcohol tobacco has long been subject to regulatory controlsover the quantity and quality of production on the other hand sumptuary laws affectingtobacco have been far fewerand weakerthan those aimed at alcohol in fact there hasnever been a time when tobacco was prohibited throughout the united states althoughconsumption under certain circumstances has been forbidden at various times in differentjurisdictions tobaccoassociated today with smoking of cigarettes and to a lesser extent of pipesand cigarshas been popular at times for both snuffing and chewing indeed until about cigarettes were relatively rare in the united states and almost all tobacco consumeddomestically was chewed during the midth century gottsegen   what ever the preferred mode of consumption however the commodity has always beenthe subject of debate respecting the appropriate governmental attitude on the one handproponents of the leaf stress its social benefits and its economic and industrialsignificance some enthusiasts even endorse its alleged medical and psychologicalbenefits opposed are those who cite the health hazards of smoking and others who areconvinced of its immorality the motivation for regulation has come from both sides of the controversy mostsumptuary restrictions were fostered by the latter group in an effort to suppress thehabit those who seek to institutionalize and foster use of the drug focus on theregulation of the quantity and quality of production this section does not attempt to weigh the merits of the various regulatory schemesrather it will trace from john rolfes day the three threads of regulation which havecircumscribed both the producer and consumer of tobacco in the united states regulation of production in the opinion of king james i of england tobacco was loathsome to the eyehateful to the nose harmful to the brain and dangerous to the lungsmiddleton   whether the king was prescient or simply sensitive was irrelevantin the th and th centuries however for tobacco rapidly became the mainstay of themaryland and virginia economics within seven years of john rolfes first imaginativeexperiment virginia exported nothing but tobacco and a little sassafrass to englandmiddleton   almost as quickly the leaf became the staple of the colony ofmaryland and competition developed in carolina as well in massachusetts bay the product fared less well the first general letter april from an official of the new england company to the massachusetts bay settlersprohibited the planting of tobacco except in small quantities for medicinal purposeswerner   next door in connecticut however the colonists attempted to rivalthe southern planters with a local leaf indeed the infant industry was coddled by theprotectionist general court at new haven which promulgated a rule in  that no persons within this jurisdiction shall smoke any other tobacco but such as isor shall be planted within these districts except they have license from the courte tobaccoinstitute connecticut undated  notwithstanding the royal attitude and the fear of certain patent holders of the londoncompany that virginia had become a colony founded on smoke tobaccoinstitute virginia    middleton   england encouraged the growth ofthe tobacco industry monopolies to import tobacco from the colonies were granted by thecrown to court favorites who soon prospered as a result of this trade in  a bill was introduced which according to one contemporary commentator wasextremely remarkable no tobacco was to be imported after the st of october except from virginia and bermuda and after that day none was to be planted inengland although the act was initially defeated by the house of lords james i in himself granted the import monopoly to the virginia and bermuda companies and prohibitedthe domestic cultivation of tobacco brooks   the system worked well for the british importers but the methods of financing theyemployed became onerous to the colonial planters the tobacco was marketed by consignmentto an english merchant who deposited the proceeds of the sale to the planters accountsoften however the high commissions charged and the cost of goods ordered by thevirginians in payment for their crop contributed to the growth of colonial indebtednessthe extension of credit to cover the deficiencies caused the debts to grow constantly butthe only alternative to the consignment system was to sell the product in the colony at alower price middleton   industrial competition in this market provided the impulse for certain regulatoryrelief importation of the carolinian product into virginia was forbidden by an act of amended in  to prohibit importation by land as well as by sea nor was northcarolina permitted to export its tobacco from virginia ports in great britain the privycouncil looked with disfavor upon such colonial legislation which threatened the financialwellbeing of the merchants and so disallowed the virginia act in  middleton  competition similarly induced both virginia and maryland to enact laws prescribing thedimensions of the hogshead in which tobacco was packaged in  vying for purchasersthe two colonies gradually enlarged the statutory size of the hogshead until under edictfrom the privy council in britain maryland was ordered to pass a gauge act establishingthe size of the hogshead in the same dimensions as those fixed in virginia notwithstanding such legislation however the manufacture of hogsheads was stillcharacterized by carelessness and irregularity until the warehouse inspection system wentinto effect in the th century middleton   it was not long before the colonial planters were faced with a more seriousproblemoverproductionwhich was causing a decline in prices as well as quality of theleaf in  the first tobacco inspection law was passed by the virginia house ofburgesses ordering the lowest grade of tobacco to be destroyed and prohibitingsecond growth tobacco and the marketing of trash leaves this act was followed in  by a more direct attempt to restrict production eachcultivator was required to limit his growth to  plants of nine leaves each althoughthis order was soon rescinded as a patent failure an act of  permitted each planterto tend only  plants with an additional allowance of  for nonlaboring women andeach child brooks   notwithstanding the statutory effort the problem intensified virginia attempted toencourage the other tobacco colonies to reach agreements restricting plantings but inmaryland lord baltimore resisted if planters were poor he asserted it is not from the low price of tobacco but from their owne sloth ill husbandryand profusely spending their croppe in brandewine and other liquors robert  carolina maryland and virginia actually reached a decision to prohibit the planting ofthe staple from february  to february  this stint proved a lesseffective means of control than the winds of  which almost destroyed the crop readyfor harvest that year tobacco institute virginia   acts of god failed to provide an ultimate solution however and severe economicdislocation in maryland and virginia intensified by  the virginia governor lordculpeper complained  that which is more to us than all other things put together and will be thespeedy and certain ruin of the colony is the low price of tobacco the thing is so fataland desperate that there is no remedy the market is overstocked and every crop overstocksit more it is commonly said that there is tobacco enough now in london to last allengland for five years our thriving is our undoing and our purchase of negroes byincreasing the supply of tobacco has greatly contributed thereto brooks  the failure of the virginia assembly to pass another act requiring a stintled the socalled cutters and pluckers to take the matter into their own handsin  by burning both their own crops and the plants of their neighbors roberts  the riot stimulated legislative action in  of a less helpful sort thedestruction of tobacco was made a criminal offense subject to the death penalty brooks  seventeenth century quality control laws proved no more successful in the effort torelieve the depression of the industry renewed efforts were made in early years of thenext century however in  the virginia house of burgesses established a warehouse system to enforcetobacco inspection forty public warehouses were created strong opposition to the systemled the privy council to disallow the act in  but the ensuing depression of thes was convincing evidence of the need for relief accordingly the system wasreinstated with british approval in  cornplete with public warehouses and officialinspectors middleton   the apparent success of the system appealed to maryland suffering also from a surfeitof tobacco tobacco our money is worth nothing wrote one marylander in and there is not a shirt to be had for tobacco this year in all our countrytobacco institute maryland   tobacco riots ensued when the mary and assembly initially refused to follow virginiasexample one individual was moved to inform lord baltimore that no improvement in theeconomic state of the colony was possible until inspection laws were passed thatwill prevent the sending to market such trash as is unfit for any other use butmanure tobacco institute maryland   accordingly maryland followedvirginia in the creation of an inspection system in and carolina did likewise in brooks   tobacco entirely dominated the economic and social structure of virginia and marylandtobacco requires us to abhor communities or townships wrote a th centurygovernor of maryland since a planter cannot carry on his affairs withoutconsiderable elbow room within his plantation brooks   in virginia tobacco had gained such ascendancy that it was used as money for examplewhen in  a cargo of twelve young women made its way to the colony each one wasvalued at  pounds of the best leaf brooks   by law virginias ministerswere paid in tobacco at  pounds annually in  the law provided that a competent and sufficient provision for the clergy will be the only means to supplythis dominion with able and faithful ministers whereby the glory of god may beadvancedthe church propagated and the people edified werner   not until the option act was passed by the virginia assembly in  could the clergysfees be paid in either money or tobacco brooks   the regulation of tobacco in the colonies was devised in response to the industry withthe intent to further the prosperity of the planters who dominated the economy this themecontinued to pervade all related regulatory efforts in the tobaccoproducing statesthereafter as new practices developed in the marketing of the leaf the initial hogshead inspection system gradually gave way to the sale of looseleaftobacco by auction in  the virginia code recognized these methods in lieu of the saleof hogsheads of the leaf as provided in the  act by  the tobacco auction hadcompletely replaced the earlier marketing techniques in virginia tobacco institutevirginia   more than a half century later maryland followed suit in  the looseleaf auctionwarehouse system was introduced to replace the hogshead system and the conversionoccurred almost overnight the practices engaged in are regulated by the maryland statetobacco authority established in  by law the authority itself is supervised by eightrepresentatives selected by the governor from the producing counties the university ofmaryland the buyers and the sellers tobacco institute maryland   the federal government came to recognize the significance of the tobacco industry inresponse to state pressures accordingly since  several bills have been enacted toaid the growers enacted in  the tobacco inspection act directs the secretary of agriculture toestablish quality standards and to designate auction markets  usc  b and dthe following year the tobacco control act was passed bestowing congressional approvalupon state compacts which regulate the production of tobacco and subsidizing the expensesof the state commissions involved  usc  thus the two elements of initialcolonial regulation were preserved the encouragement of quality and the discouragement ofquantity the latter objective was further implemented by the agricultural adjustment act of since that time parity payments have been made to tobacco producers in amounts which together with the proceeds thereof will provide a return to suchproducers which is as nearly equal to parity price as the funds so made available willpermit  usc  in addition the secretary of agriculture is authorized to set national marketingquotas respecting each kind of tobacco  usc  to apportion the quotas among thestates and to allot the portions among the farms  usc  penalties are imposedfor overproduction  usc  there is nothing subtle about these measures of course their intent is obvious toassure the economic stability of an industry which as of  provided the united statespopulation with more than  pounds of manufactured tobacco for

northern colonies were less enthusiastic about the habit however in the general court of massachusetts bay took the initiative and forbade smoking inpublic tinder penalty of a fine tobacco institute

exposed to the stimulus of the smoke or juice of tobacco a desireof course is excited for strong drinks and these when taken between meals soon lead tointemperance and drunkenness one of the greatest

writer first suggestedthe relation in  in cautions against the immoderate use ol snuff he reported sixcases of polypusses related to excessive indulgence in tobacco in the form ofsnuff one such polypus was described as a swelling in one nostril that washard black and adherent on a broad base painless at first it later developed allthe frightful symptoms of an open cancer dr hill believed that this lesion couldbe fatal and placed the blame for its origin on tobacco dr hill has been noted as thefirst to report an association of tobacco with cancer redmond   in  the first scientific study linking lung cancer with smoking was publishedbetween  and   studies associating cigarettes and serious diseases werecompleted fritschler   at the present time there is no government agency with

statement from the public health service on the subject was made by itssurgeon general leroy f burney md in the journal of the american medical associationin november  the heart of this statement was

comprehensive review of all data on smoking and health the members of this committee were respected scientists who had previously expressed noopinion about the relationship of tobacco to health all members were approved forappointment by the tobacco industry as well as by the american medical association andseveral national health agencies half of the committee members were cigarette smokers on

cigarette smoking far outweighs otherfactors the data for women though less extensive point in the same direction airpollution was found to be a very minor factor in the cause of the disease far outweighedby cigarette smoking the death rate from heart disease the report noted was  percent higher in cigarettesmokers than in nonsmokers and although there was not enough evidence to say positivelythat smoking causes heart disease there was enough to assume that it is a cause and totake action against it another conclusion of great importance was that cigarette smoking is the mostimportant of the causes of chronic bronchitis in the united states and increases the riskof dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema the report analyzed the statistical pathological clinical and experimental evidencein relation to smoking and other diseases a total of more than  published reportswere studied and more than  investigators were personally interviewed the resultwas the most comprehensive and authoritative report on this subject ever madediehl   the health warning requirement at the time the surgeon generals report was published no statute administrativeruling or court decision required that cigarette packaging or advertising contain anystatement about the dangers to health attributable to cigarette smoking after trade regulation rule proceedings in march and june  the federal tradecommission concluded that cigarette advertising was deceptive misleading and thatadvertisers had a responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of cigarettesmoking to accomplish this the commission proposed that cigarette packages state the amount oftar and nicotine in the smoke of the cigarette which the package contains and thatcigarette packages and cigarette advertising carry a statement such as cautioncigarette smoking is dangerous to health it may cause death from cancer and otherdiseases this warning was to be required on cigarette packages beginning january   and incigarette advertising beginning july   the tobacco industry first obtained apostponement of the effective dates of this ruling and then prevailed upon congress tovitiate the ruling by passing the cigarette labeling and advertising act requiring allpackages of cigarettes sold in this country to carry the label cigarette smoking maybe hazardous to your health but prohibiting the federal trade commission and stateand local governments from requiring any other label on cigarette packages and anywarnings in cigarette advertising at least until  a new york times editorial called the cigarette labeling and advertising act of a shocking piece of specialinterest legislationa bill to protect the economichealth of the tobacco industry by freeing it of proper regulation cigarettelabeling and advertising  an article in the atlantic monthly described thepolitical maneuvering behind this legislation under the title the quiet victory ofthe cigarette lobby how it found the best filter yetcongress diehl  public concern attending publication of the surgeon generals report smoking andhealth and the pending ftc regulations for warnings on cigarette packages and incigarette advertising apparently convinced the tobacco industry that some action bycongress was inevitable reportedly the industry decided to accept a weak label on cigarette packages providedthat the legislation would prevent any regulation of cigarette advertising this wasaccomplished by inserting into the proposed law the provision precluding the ftc and allstate or local governments from requiring any warning on cigarette packages other than theone approved by congress and also preventing any warnings in cigarette advertising at house and senate committee hearings committee members friendly to the industryattempted to discredit both the surgeon generals report and the testimony given by thesurgeon general the chairman of the federal trade commission and the representatives ofvarious medical and health organizations the tobacco industry then presented a number ofphysicians who testified that they disagreed with the conclusions of the surgeon generalsadvisory committee and that in their opinion there was no real evidence that cigarettesmoking is harmful diehl   although this act temporarily prevented any requirement that tar and nicotine contentbe indicated on cigarette packages the federal trade commission did establish alaboratory to determine the tar and nicotine content of the smoke of cigarettes on theamerican market making the results of these tests available periodically to the public the cigarette labeling and advertising act also required that about july   andannually thereafter the federal trade commission report to congress concerning theeffectiveness of the warning label and upon current practices of cigarette advertisingand promotion with recommendations for legislation that are deemedappropriate after an intensive study the federal trade commission made a detailed report tocongress with the following summary and recommendations there is virtually noevidence that the warning statement on cigarette packages has had any significanteffect sales remained constant and the industry continued to invest hundreds of millions ofdollars in advertising  million a year was being spent on radio and television alonein  cigarette advertisers had become the single largest product advertisers ontelevision accounting for about eight per cent of television advertising time wagner  the fairness doctrine another government agency had become concerned with cigarette advertising the federalcommunications commission is mandated to assure that the airways which belong to thepublic are used in the public interest john p banzhaf iii who has been called the ralph nader of the tobaccoindustry was responsible for the fccs involvement in the cigarette advertisingcontroversy after viewing several cigarette commercials on television banzhaf concludedthat what he was seeing might be considered legally controversial wagner  he then wrote to wcbstv in new york on december   requesting that heor some other responsible spokesman be given an opportunity to present contrasting viewson the issue of the benefits and advisability of smoking banzhafs letter cited three commercials that presented the view that smoking issocially acceptable and desirable manly and a necessary part of a rich full lifehe askedfree time roughly approximate to that spent on the promotion of thevirtues and values of smoking cbs routinely turned down the request he senta second letter to cbs and submitted a formal complaint against wcbstv to the fcc inwashington the fcc in a letter to the television station dated june   said programs it hadbroadcast dealing with the effect of smoking on health were insufficient to offset theeffects of paid advertisements broadcast for a total of five to  minutes each broadcastday we hold that the fairness doctrine is applicable to such advertisementsthe commission said they rejected banzhafs claim for equal time however the fcc called on the station to provide free each week a significant amount oftime for the other viewpoint thereby implementing the smoking education campaignslaunched by the government under the cigarette labeling law this requirement willnot preclude or curtail presentation by stations of cigarette advertising which theychoose to carry the fcc basically decided that it was not in the public interestfor the airways to be used by radio and television to advertise cigarettes without somewarning of the health hazards involved with smoking wagner   the fcc was deluged with requests to reconsider its action the agency stood firm inits unanimous decision as a result of the ruling many of the voluntary health agenciesand the public health service made available to the television and radio industries spotannouncements and other program materials on the serious consequences to health caused bycigarette smoking the fccs decision was upheld by the us court of appeals on november   thecourt said the agency could indeed use its fairness doctrine to require free time forantismoking commercials the danger cigarettes may pose to health is among othersa danger to life itself the court said as the commission emphasized it is a danger inherent in the normal use of the productnot one merely associated with its abuse or dependent on intervening fortuitous events itthreatens a substantial body of the population not merely a peculiarly susceptible fringegroup moreover the danger though not established beyond all doubt is documented by acompelling cumulation of statistical evidence wagner  l the cigarette manufacturers then asked the supreme court to review their case but thehigh court turned down the request leaving the appeals court decision standing most observers agree that the dramatic entrance of the fcc into the smokingcontroversy was probably the most important single event during the threeyear moratoriumon requiring health warnings in cigarette advertisements imposed by congress on theftc wagner    the ban on advertising both the us public health service and federal trade commission have annually reportedfindings to congress since passage of the cigarette labeling law the ftc recommended thatthe act should be amended to warning cigarette smoking is dangerous to health andmay cause death from cancer and other diseases additionally the ftc recommended legislation to require the same warning to appear inall cigarette advertisements and to require statements of tar and nicotine content on allcigarette packages and in all advertising legislation to accomplish these objectives as well as the following were recommended bythe ftc cigarette advertising on television and radio should be barred entirelyalternately cigarette advertising on television and radio should be limited as to hoursin which it may appear the extent to which it may appear and the types of programs onwhich it may appear increased appropriations should be made to the department of health education andwelfare for education of the public especially young people as to the health hazards ofsmoking appropriations should be made for research under the direction of the nationalinstitutes of health on the development of less hazardous cigarettes by  the stage had been set for a showdown over cigarette advertising andpromotion wagner   the us government was increasing its efforts todiscourage the sale of cigarettes post

 that it would no longer accept such advertising becauseaccumulated medical evidence has indicated that cigarette smoking is hazardous tohealth wagner   in april  a few weeks before the house interstate and foreign commerce committeewas scheduled to open hearings on the ftc proposals a series of bills were introduced inthe house by representatives of tobacco producing states one such bill hr cosponsored by all eleven of north carolinas house delegation proposed toestablish a comprehensive federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertisingwith respect to any relationship between smoking and health identical measures were introduced under the sponsorship of congressmen from virginiamaryland kentucky and florida some accounts of the activity on capitol hill during thisperiod attribute these bills to the tobacco interests intention to preventstrengthening of the warning label and make permanent the ban on state and federalregulation of cigarette advertising which was due to expire on june  passage of thislegislation was the best tobacco interests could have hoped for under thecircumstances wagner   after testimony from both sides the house committee approved a stiffer health warningbut prohibited regulatory action on cigarette advertising for six years and in other waysgenerally upheld the status quo the senate commerce committee on december   voted out a bill banning cigarettecommercials from the air as of january   the ftc was prohibited from acting oncigarette ads in newspapers and magazines until the middle of  the labeling provisionin the senate bill was weaker than that established in the housevoted measure and thebill also precluded cigarette regulatory action by the fifty states and local governments in a session on december  a floor amendment was introduced which loosened thecommittees proposed restriction on the ftc by allowing the agency to require healthwarnings in advertising as of july   the bill also authorized the ftc to movesooner if it found that tobacco companies were switching from broadcast to printadvertising so massively that it could be considered a  gross abuse this billalso approved a new required health warning for cigarette packageswarning cigarettesmoking is dangerous to your health after senate passage the measure still had to pass a joint senatehouse conferencecommittee where important differences between the two bills had to be reconciled the bill that emerged from conference differed only slightly from the senate measurethe cautionary label to which the conferees agreed provides warning the surgeongeneral has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health ina final concession to the broadcasters the conferees agreed to delay for one day theblackout of cigarette commercials from december   to midnight january  that would give them a last shower of cash from the new years day football bowlgames wagner   it was estimated that the loss to television and radiostations would amount to about  million a year or about  of their totaladvertising revenues president nixon signed the act on april   some observers marvel that the bill was passed in spite of massive pressure thathad been brought to bear against it and against the regulation of cigarette advertisinggenerally by the tobacco industry the broadcasting industry and the lobbyists and theirpolitical allies this was a combination that for years had proved invincible against acounterforce of scientists and public health and public interest advocates who armed withformidable statistics on the damage to health and life caused by cigarette smoking hadsought to protect consumers by requiring all cigarette advertising to provide adequatewarnings of these dangers whiteside   there are those observers  on the other hand who do not view the ban of cigaretteadvertising on television and radio as such a success for the consumer rather they citethe statistics on consumption in other countries to point up the fact that bans onadvertising do not reduce sales in czechoslovakia for example no direct advertising of tobacco is permitted yetconsumption increased  between  and  advertising of foreign cigarettes wasbanned in  in italy the following year sales increased  and in   sales increased in england after television cigarette advertisements were banned in consumption figures for the following three years in britain reveal increases  billioncigarettes in   billion in  and  billion in  cigarette advertising  robert miller an agricultural economist in the department of agricultures economicresearch service reports that cigarette consumption is up in every part of the worldalthough advertising was banned in several european countries some years ago he predictsan eventual decrease in sales during the next five years and perhaps a  decrease intobacco consumption tobacco advertising could end   other observers can see a gradual reduction in cigarette consumption as a result of aprohibition on advertising some feel a ban on advertising merely makes it difficult tolaunch a new brand others predict that the ban will eliminate the social acceptability ofthe habit although consumption will not go down the live dangerously novelty has also been identified as a possible causefor gains in consumption such a philosophy might well be prevalent among the youngthe very ones that antismoking advocates are most anxious to protect cigaretteadvertising   another consequence of the ban on cigarette commercials was the fcc ruling that thebroadcasters obligation to air antismoking messages had ended the stations continue torun them as public service spots however the volume was decreased considerably from theformer  to  ratio established by the fcc the antismoking forces are fearful that adecrease in these spots is harmful to their cause and may retard their efforts to reducecigarette consumption on october  a us district court ruled that the congressional ban on cigaretteadvertising is constitutional the ruling stated that such advertising does not qualifyunder the first amendments guarantee of freedom of speech a sharp distinction was drawnbetween guarantees of freedom of speech for individuals and the limitedextent to which broadcast advertising qualifies for such protection the court also ruled that congress had more than one rational basis forexcluding cigarette ads from television and not the printed media one being thatbroadcasts are the most persuasive types of advertising cigarette ad ban ultimately the constitutional

almost  billion higher than the year prior to the surgeon generals report in  there was another significant decline it has been suggested that this declineis attributable to several highvisibility

during the public outcry was being felt by economic interestsmagazines newspaperspersonalities and advertising agencies which refused sponsorship for business from tobaccocompanies there were

believed that the role ofcigarette advertising is to attract smokers from competitive brands rather than inducenonsmokers to start smoking we failed to convince the federal communications commissionof this but it is borne out by our industrys experience since the tv ban within arelatively stable market some companies have continued to gain while others lost somebrands have increased their share of market while others have declined wherecigarette makers spend   skeptics continue to argue that tobacco companies havealso been trying to recruit new young smokers tobacco economics and politics it is generally accepted that tobacco has been an extremely powerful force in americanpolitics approximately  million smokers smoked  billion cigarettes in the past yearmore than  employees receive  million in wages annually from tobaccomanufacturing companies over  wholesalers handle the distribution of tobaccoproducts and hundreds of thousands of merchants depend on tire sale of cigarettes as asource of their income cigarette companies had been spending over  million per year on radio andtelevision advertising and since the ban almost all of this money has been diverted toother media advertising

research created in  in response to medical bulletinsreporting on the hazards of smoking processes and administers millions of researchgrants although research money was to be awarded with no strings attached thecouncil nicely serves the purpose of identifying the industry with the welfare ofhumanity and spreading good will through the scientific community wagner  the scientific data continue to be attacked from both sides since  a greatquantity of research has been published and in turn disputed for example thepress played up the hammond and auerbach study and the claim that twelve beagles haddeveloped lung cancer from cigarettes the findings have subsequently beendowngraded by  v the author to two microscopic tumors with the further revelation thattwo dogs in the control group also developed tumors maxwell   another area of contention has developed around the relationship between cigarettesmoke itself and lung cancer a recent paper by dr geoffrey myddelton given at the secondworld conference on smoking and health in london september   compares theincidence of smoking and lung cancer in various countries he indicates japansmokes  as much as britain but has only  of

other side the united states public health service  report the healthconsequences of smoking maintains that nonsmokers as well as smokers may be harmedby cigarettes    tobacco smoke in closed cars and poorly ventilated rooms cancontaminate the atmosphere for everyone    the chief danger is exposure to low levelsof the deadly gas carbon monoxide experiments with animals have shown that variousconcentrations of the colorless odorless and tasteless gas adversely affect thestructure and function of the heart and lungs the implication is that this may also betrue in man study says cigarette smoke also may harm nonusers   it is estimated that at the present time one and a half to two million adults give upsmoking every year sensing the hazards of the future some cigarette companies soughtfiscal security in diversification and substitution tobacco manufacturers are nowmarketing for example safety razors fertilizers dog food ballpoint pens peanutbutter and other nonnicotine products by  sales on nontobacco products accountedfor approximately onethird of the total sales of cigarette manufacturers it remains to be seen whether tobacco power will be whittled away any further in thenext few years some feel that the tobacco subsystem has succeeded in keeping thehealth question a low priority item on the governments agenda by playing one governmentagency off against another this subsystem cuts across institutional lines and includesthe paid representatives of tobacco growers marketing organizations and manufacturerscongressmen representing tobacco growing states are leading members of foursubcommittees including two appropriations subcommittees and two committees in eachhouse of congress handling tobacco legislation    tobacco power is thus firmlyentrenched and well supported wagner   on the other hand a strongly worded commentary by an industry spokesman cites justicejohn marshalls statement to illustrate industrys precarious position the power totax involves the power to destroy he continues with a description of the tobaccoindustrys present situation the onslaught of state and local taxes on tobacco products  represents a mostserious threat to all segments of our industry we are now facing a calculated attemptto destroy or at least drastically curtail the sale of smoking products the politicaland economic climate is most favorable for this attack smoking and health is a primepolitical issue in the same context as air pollution crime in the streets andconsumerism at the same time local governments are verging on bankruptcy revenue of anysort is therefore a must it is a tough battle and cigarette industry is currentlybearing the largest part of the attack regensburg   the revenues gained from tobacco tax collections are significant over  billion infederal taxes and over  billion in state cigarette taxes were collected in fiscal year tobacco tax council    usda tobacco situation b  totaltobacco taxes were  billion in  compared with  billion in  in  tobacco taxes accounted for  of total federal tax receipts and represented percent of all excise taxes usda tobacco situation b  this places thetobacco tax as the seventh largest source of collection by the federal government behindthe major giants eg income and profit taxes both corporate and individualemployment taxes manufacturers excise taxes alcohol taxes and estate and gift taxes interms of individual commodities it ranks behind only alcohol thus federal revenue wouldbe importantly affected if tobacco consumption were to decline conclusion the big question is how the federal government plans to proceed six tobacco bills arenow pending in congress one of these bills would give the federal trade commissionauthority to set maximum permissible limits on tar and nicotine another would establish agraduated cigarette tax based on tar content the ftc is presently carrying on negotiations with the industry to come up with

persuade them not to start smoking and  of those who smoked said theirphysicians advice would influence them to stop doctors   critics of the industry claim the controversy about smoking and health continueslargely because of the energy time and money spent by the tobacco industry in keepingthis controversy alive college poll  in september  fortune magazine published a discussion of the medical implicationsof smoking it concluded that this much can be said that the possible benefit to be derived from tobacco isalways less than the possible harm robert   official policy has never accepted this judgment in recent years steps have beentaken to discourage smoking although there is little conclusive evidence that consumptionpatterns are changing it can be expected that official policy and
