UltimateFatBurner.com features three "Walls of Shame"; the first highlights companies that have poor ratings with the Better Business Bureau and established track records of poor customer service and deceptive billing tactics. The second highlights a list of companies that have used the threat of lawsuits to attempt to get us to remove or alter our reviews. The third lists companies have violated copyright laws by stealing our content and passing it off as their own. Have you been ripped off by a supplement company?

Just move your mouse to the right, and in one swift quick click, we'll show you how to complain to the appropriate authorities, as well as provide you with some crucial "need to know" information to prevent anything like this ever happening again.

Dr Oz, the well known TV personality who first came into fame on the Oprah Winfrey show, often makes recommendations for weight loss supplements on his show. Although Dr. Oz stays away from making specific product endorsements, he frequently discusses ingredients that in his opinion, show great promise. We've started looking closely at the Oz's recommendations, and reporting on the clinical data (if any) that supports his assertions. You might be surprised at our conclusions. Some products that have received accolades and exposure on the Dr. Oz show recently are raspberry ketones, 7-Keto DHEA, Coleus forskohlii, Saffron extract (Satiereal) and African Mango. Click any of the previous to find out the complete skinny about Dr. Oz's recommendations. Watch Video: Our New Video Section Is Live! Now You Can Watch! For the last month or so we've been working away on a new "video" section here on UltimateFatBurner.com. And no, this is not the place where we dump a bunch of YouTube videos - we've created all this material ourselves, and we are working hard on building it into a huge and comprehensive resource. So, if you like to watch your information rather than read it, the new video section is for you! Visit today! The "Testimonials" Scam Do Testimonials Influence Your Purchasing Decisions? They do for a lot of people. Online, and off. Offline, testimonials come from people you know, so they are instantly qualified—if the testimonial comes from a person you respect, you are likely to heed the recommendation. If you distrust the person, or feel maybe they are recommending the product to you for personal gain, you don't. Online, it's a different story. WAY different. Different in that you cannot authenticate any comment from anyone, anywhere. You can't tell whether the comment is genuine, or whether it comes from some one with an ulterior motive; maybe the person works for the retailer, or earns a commission from referred sales from the product, or maybe he or she is employed by a competitor to post negative testimonials or feedback on a product. But what about when the comment, testimonials or feedback resides on a trusted retailer's site? It makes no difference. Retailers cannot verify these comments either. Watch this video to see how easy it is to flood the internet with tons of positive feedback for your product, for a minimal cost. Only Available Online! Are You Researching Fat Burners Sold Only Online? If you are, you need to know how to avoid getting ripped off. Because unless you are purchasing from a nationally recognized company, there's a good chance things aren't going to go well for you—especially if you want to obtain a refund, or you order a "free trial" product and try to cancel the monthly billing program to which you've suddenly found youself added. Luckily, there are ways to protect yourself. The best way? By reading our "How To Avoid Getting Scammed / Ripped Off Buying Supplements Online" article. Trust us, the time you spend reading this will pay you back huge dividends, save you tons of heartache, and keep your money in your pocket where it belongs! If You're Really Serious... Burn The Fat, Feed The Muscle Tom Venuto's Burn The Fat, Feed The Muscle is an intense, but extremely good online best seller. It's one of our favorite diets ever but it's not for the faint of heart. As Tom himself says... "Losing weight is simple, but it's not easy." If you're dedicated and not afraid of rolling up your sleeves and getting to work, Burn The Fat is an essential tool for building an incredible physique that you can be proud of... and that will be the envy of all!

Since 1999, our visitors have been trusting our science-based reviews (why should you care about science?) to provide them with the real skinny on weight loss, dieting, and sport nutrition supplements. Unlike our competitors, our mandate is not the sale of supplements (we are fans of good products though, and will make a recommendation should the circumstances merit), it's the education of our visitor... you! UltimateFatBurner.com is supported by advertising, not by product sales. This allows us to present a real, unbiased synopsis of each product we review. And check our real visitor comments too. These aren't the manufactured testimonials that you'll see elsewhere on the Net. They are real comments from real, often angry people -- visitors who have used these products, and often, aren't too darn happy about it.
