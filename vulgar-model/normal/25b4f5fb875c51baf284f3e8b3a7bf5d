It gave Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee for president who is scrambling to improve his ratings among women voters, a chance to reach out to them through his wife. And it sent Democratic President Obama's top campaign staff members - and by Thursday afternoon, the president and first lady - rushing to disavow the pundit's remark.

He is also the author of the book, "How We Do Harm: A Doctor Breaks Ranks About Being Sick in America." (CNN) -- Q: This week the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued preliminary guidelines for ovarian cancer screening. It recommends against routine screening saying that the risk of false positive diagnoses outweighs the benefits. How can this be and why is it so hard to find a good screening test for ovarian cancer? A: The U,S. Preventive Services Task Force is a group of medical experts who assess the scientific literature on an issue, such as ovarian cancer screening, before making a recommendation. They do influence how doctors practice medicine. The statement recommends against routine ovarian cancer screening because they find the evidence of harm associated with screening is greater than the evidence of benefit.

Security Council will meet Friday to discuss North Korea's botched long-range missile launch -- an act U.N. officials called deplorable and destabilizing despite its failure. Amid concerns that North Korea will try to recover from the embarrassing failure with a nuclear test or military move, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned the secretive country's regime not to "undertake further provocative actions that will heighten tension in the region." The missile launch was heralded by North Korea as "an inspiring deed and an event of historic significance." The missile broke apart shortly after launch Friday morning, then fell into the ocean. North Korea said the missile was designed to carry an observation satellite into orbit. But the United States, South Korea and Japan said that was a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. The launch drew condemnation from United States and countries in the region, as well as an unusual admission of failure from Pyongyang. The normally secretive regime has previously insisted that failed launches had actually been successful.

Invisible Children, which shot to prominence last month when its video on Kony and his brutal Lord's Resistance Army drew more than 100 million hits on social media, told Ugandan officials that a man wanted by security forces was staying with the group in the northern Ugandan city of Gulu, the cable showed. Patrick Komakech, the former child soldier who was featured in Invisible Children documentaries and said to have been abducted by Kony's rebels at age 9, was immediately arrested, according to U.S. document, posted in a database of classified cables published by Wikileaks. "Komakech had confessed to being part of a new anti-government movement in the north," the 2009 State Department cable said. "Komakech reportedly gave the locations of several arms caches... with a total of 600 weapons." The "Kony 2012" video, the latest in a series of documentaries by the group, has been hailed for inspiring young people to activism. But the video has also been criticized for what some have called a misleading and oversimplified portrayal of events in Uganda, and for neglecting African initiatives to solve the crisis as well as opening up old wounds.

Dioncounda Traore, the former parliament speaker, was sworn into office in the capital of the west African nation on Thursday, at a ceremony attended by, among others, junta leader Captain Amadou Sanogo who grabbed power in a March 22 coup. Traore, 70, took charge in a country facing its worst-ever crisis, threatening to unleash "total war'' on the Tuareg rebels, Islamists and outlaws who overran Mali's vast desert north in the power vacuum created by the coup. "I am aware of being the president of a country at war," said the mathematician turned politician, who is expected to name a prime minister and organise elections within 40 days.

Hillary Rodham Clinton has a tech-savvy sense of humor, and she wants you to know it. The secretary of state is firmly embracing an Internet parody that purports to show her texting various politicians and celebrities, shooting them down with snappy retorts. Clinton invited the creators of the "Texts from Hillary" Tumblr website to the State Department on Tuesday and shared a laugh with them. And, she even submitted her own fake exchange. The site has become an Internet sensation since it was launched last week. It is based on photographs of Clinton, wearing sunglasses, surrounded by briefing papers and staring at her Blackberry, aboard a military transport plane flying to Libya in October. In it, the captions show her launching imaginary witty ripostes at her husband, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and others who are all depicted in photos looking at smartphones and distracting Clinton from important work at hand.

But there's no more opponents. Three candidates have officially dropped out: Santorum, Rick Perry and Jon Huntsman. The super PACs supporting them had spent more than $14 million combined, and now they're floating in campaign finance purgatory — not spending any more money but not dead yet. The Red White and Blue Fund, a super PAC backing Santorum, said that Santorum was "suspending his campaign but not the fight. The PAC supporting Huntsman, Our Destiny, said that after the former ambassador quit the race, it returned all its unused money to the benefactors who had donated it. But the apparatus is still in place and "could spring into action" at a moment's notice for whatever reason, said Fred Davis, a Republican ad man who runs the PAC.

Bridgeport Superintendent Paul Vallas said he believes the boy took his stepfather's jacket to school on Monday without knowing the drugs were inside it. "Children bring to school what they find at home," he said. Police have told the Connecticut Post the boy took 50 packets of heroin out when it came time for a show-and-tell presentation, but Vallas said the boy only waved the heroin around at his cubicle. Police did not respond to messages seeking comment Tuesday. The boy's stepfather, 35-year-old Santos Roman, went to the school and recovered the jacket, but police had already seized the drugs, officials said. He was arrested when he returned to the school after apparently discovering the heroin was missing, Vallas said.

This should include getting internal auditors to check on their books of accounts.  The report noted under valuing assets, lack of documentary evidence on expenses and utilised money and actual accountability not matching as some of the problems that required attention.  He advised all to create internal audit systems to regulate expenditure and advise accordingly.  "An internal audit function assists management in assessing internal control systems, risk management and governance and where there are deficiencies suggest improvements," said part of the over 300 page report. NCS was also blamed for having no job descriptions for the positions of Internal Auditor, Senior Assistant Secretary, Office Superintendent and Senior Administrative Secretary.  "This may result into role conflict and failure to apportion responsibility."  The auditor general blamed the lack of internal check for a loss of sh22.5m from the stadium expenses and a doubtful sh7m in trustee expenses.  More Posted by nico at 7:03 AM 0 comments Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to Facebook Links to this post Reactions:  Uganda: VP Ssekandi Woos Nordic Investors The Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi has urged Ugandans working in the Nordic countries to invest in Uganda, describing the investment climate as "very rife". Ssekandi made the remarks while giving a key note address during the first ever Ugandan Diaspora convention in the Nordic countries held on the DFDS Cruise at the Oslo habour on Saturday.

"I challenged the convention to mobilize Ugandans and friends of Uganda in northern Europe to embrace the business opportunities that exist in Uganda and begin contributing to the developing of the country," he said. According to statistics, Ugandans in the Diaspora contributed over $ 800 million to Uganda last year. Ssekandi who also delivered President Museveni's contribution of 10,000 US dollars towards the convention said the government will always recognize Ugandans living and working in the Nordic as its own people and encouraged them to apply for dual citizenship to ease their movements as they go about with their businesses.
