enjoying hookah indoors  hookah lounge blog loading forums blog hookah wiki pictures lounge directory enjoying hookah indoors by kalutika on january   smoking hookah indoors is something that a lot of people disagree on some people would never even think about it and others do it on a daily basis i fall into the second category and do so with very little worry let us list some of the concerns that people have regarding smoking risk of fire lingering smell discolored walls or blinds disgruntled landlords or parents each of these concerns has a fairly simple answer regarding the smoking of hookah risk of fire with all forms of smoking there is an inherent risk of fire with hookah the tobacco is roasted under glowing hot charcoal and if they fall off or come in contact with flammable material it could result in fire most likely you will have a smoldering situation the temperature that charcoal burns at when at rest is relatively low compared to an actual flame this is what lets us cook tobacco rather than ignite it this also means that actual ignition is not that likely unless you are smoking with piles of paper or flammable liquids around the hookah i dont suggest this a long time ago there was an event that i am happy to have not been a part of a friend of mine had lit his hookah and part way through the session he got distracted another friend was walking through the house almost half an hour later and smell something similar to sharpies the cat had knocked the coal off the bowl somehow and it had melted through the carpet and burnt a nice black spot into the hardwood floor we have no idea how long the coal was there but based on the depth of the burn i would say around  minutes thats a long time the house still stands so long as you are careful with the charcoal you are not at risk for losing your living arrangements unless of course you let coals burn into the hardwood some advice for avoiding cosmetic damage to your house and carpet dont put the hookah on any unstable surface like a poorly built table or deep carpeting when moving the hookah make sure to have your wind cover on or take the coals off the bowl all together dont pull on the hose to adjust the hookah dont put hookahs in high traffic areas dont leave hookahs unattended keep pets away lingering smell lingering smells are one of the biggest concerns with smoking what about hookah dont worry about it the scent a hookah puts out is pleasant and does not stick to anything easily for the most part if you air out the room the scent will be gone in short order some flavors will stick around longer than others but even very strong scents are not an issue discolored walls or blinds smoke has a tendency to discolor light colored paints and plastic over a long period of time this is a result of tar and other particles coming to rest on surfaces and causing minor staining that builds up over time this can be seen at a much faster rate if a cigarette smoker draws smoke through a piece of paper towel or fine cloth the ruslt is a nasty brown stain on the clothpaper that really makes ya think if you do the same with a hookah you will get nothing more than a bit of residual moisture i have never seen anything that indicates hookah smoke will stain walls or furniture i have been smoking hookah in the same room with a whit ceiling for a couple years now no discoloration i painted the ceiling myself and check once in a while to see if it is having any effect i have also been in a very long running hookah lounge that had a white ceiling i am doubting that they apply a new coat monthly and the ceiling was still nice and white it may cause minute staining over time but it is nothing i can see disgruntled landlords or parents if your parents or landlord prohibits smoking there is an easy way to avoid confrontations and problems dont smoke in the house find someplace else so long as its allowed where you live and you are careful with everything there should be no problems smoking hookah inside all it takes is some commonsenseand some basic courtesy happy and safe smoking to everyone leave a comment name  email  website notify me of followup comments via
