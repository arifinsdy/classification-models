Oh goodness, it was hot!! I could have swore the city moved this festival to September to avoid the Hot August Heat...oh that was so not the case. With the heat and black asphalt, it was just too hot to be there. Anyway, my twins had a blast on the rides. As always, the Dry Bean Festival is packed full of people wanting to have fun, look at the booth's and see what vendors are selling. There are out-of-towners and locals at this two day event. Here are my twins on some of the rides having fun, fun, fun!

They just love them and, like their other hats and headbands, have added this headband to their flower "collection" at the end of their bed. As of right now, my twins have nine pieces of head wear that Mommy has made them. Can you tell I love making floral head wear for not only my twins, but their friends and anyone else who wants one, two, three or more? When looking for a great baby shower, birthday or everyday head wear gift, the hats, headbands and now hair bows I make are not only cute, they are within your budget too. I love making seasonal hats and headbands, like I did with these 4th of July headbands. If there is hat or headband you want for your event or for any season, I will make them for you. The next major holiday is Thanksgiving then Christmas so I will be making hats and headbands in fall and winter colors. Let me know in advance of these holidays so I can purchase what I need now.

These are some of the colors I had in my hat, headband and flower drawer. These beanie hats are very popular right now and would make for excellent baby shower gifts, birthday gifts, an everyday gift and especially for everyday wear. Now, if I were to have my twins be models for these adorable beanie hats, they would want them, as they always do. So, like I have been doing for a while now, I just take photos of my beanie hats, individually. These hats can be worn in the winter, spring, summer and fall. These hats are best worn though it the spring, summer and fall, in my opinion. Here are photos of my newest beanie hats. When you decide to purchase one, or two, from me, please contact me via email. I have more than these colors in my hat, headband and hair bow drawer at home.
